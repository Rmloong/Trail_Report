       "{0: 'WOW! I felt this Rose of a trail for DAYS after. Gosh my quads were so sore 3-4 days after (but probably because I did it without any breaks and jogged it down). I hiked this one solo over Memorial Weekend. There were plenty of hikers on the trail throughout. I left at 1:00 and made it up 46 switchbacks (not that I was counting) an hour later to the split for the loop up Rose. I veered left and made it up to the submit in another 40 minutes and about 53 switchbacks later (I might have missed a few in an attempt to keep breathing--made it without taking a break!). The top was crowded so I want back down about 150 feet to a nice boulder that still had a great view of Rainier and the surrounding area. \\r Feeling ambitious--or rather feeling less pain in my knees jogging down then walking--I continued the loop around and headed back down. I made it to the split in 24 minutes then down in half an hour.

       " 3: \"Hiked the Mount Rose trail today. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the road to the trailhead is very rough, especially if you have a low clearance vehicle. However, it's only bad for about the last half mile to the trailhead, so its not too bad of a nuisance overall. Began hiking at 830 with only two other vehicles at the trailhead, it was very quiet on the way up which was nice to hear birds chirping and such. I reached the summit loop start point and strapped on some yak tracks and started to get after it! Made it about a 1/4 mile using taking the left loop before I decided to turn back. The snow was packed, but a lot of it was pretty loose which led to many postholes. Would definitely recommend snow shoes and a trail map as it was easy for me to get off course in the snow. Overall a great day outside and a very challenging hike for your legs!Parking lot is pretty small but more space on the road below. Beautiful switchback trail for the first two miles. At the fork both ways lead to the summit but the left one is shorter. We the right one on the way up and on the way down took the shorter one. Both start snow around .3 from the fork.

       " 6: \"I took a group of our high school's Hiking Club members on this trail today, and although it was cold and even snowed/hailed at the top it was a great hike!\\r The top of the trail is still covered in snow for about the last half mile, and the snow is about 5 feet deep in a lot of places. It's compacted, though, so you can walk on it without post holing and snowshoes definitely aren't needed. Micro spikes would have been helpful, but they aren't necessary either if you don't mind sliding a bit. The trail is also fairly easy to find so long as you follow footprints and the red markers hung in trees.  We took the left (shorter, steeper) side of the summit loop both on the way up and down, so I'm not sure about conditions on the other part of the loop.\\r The trail isn't in perfect condition -- there were several trees across the trail, a few places where the trail was a bit washed out, and the very last top section to the summit is a bit hard to follow. It's not like anyone would get lost or anything, but it's just not in the greatest shape. Overall it's a great hike though and the trail is definitely good enough if you don't mind spending an extra couple seconds making sure you're still on it.Hiked the Mount Rose trail today.

Hard to tell exactly how deep it was, but it some areas it had to be at least 5 feet deep. The snow was packed down pretty well, and we did not need to use our snow shoes. However, we did put on micro spikes! There were a couple guys in the group that did not have them, and they were fine, but micro spikes definitely made the climb up and down much easier. \\r It took us 2.5 hours to reach the summit. Once we got there, it was extremely windy and cold and covered in clouds, so we only stayed about 15 minutes before heading back down the same way we came up. Right as we were leaving, the clouds broke and we could actually see Lake Cushman below. \\r All in all, it was a very wet, but not a bad day up Rose. It's a great conditioner hike that will have you back home in Olympia before 3pm. Can't beat that!\",\n",
       " 21: 'We started up the trail arount 10:30 am. Hit frozen snow on the trail below Horse Camp, and put on our microspikes. Above Horse Camp, fresh snow made snowshoes necessary. By the time we got to the summit we were sinking in about 8\" or so on snowshoes. We reached the summit just before 2:00 pm. We didn\\'t stay long because it was snowing and windy. Took the loop down which was a nice adventure with a difficult stream crossing due to fresh blowdown blocking the small log bridge over the stream. Got back to the car about 4:30. The trail crew is going to have a busy time as there is considerable new blowdown at various spots on the trail.Made it all the way to the summit on January 2nd. The previous weekend I made it to about 4000\\' and short of the summit due to soft deep snow. Even this time I had to break trail from my previous high point to the summit. Rose in winter is safer and easier than trying to do Ellinor and gives you about the same vertical climb. I needed microspikes from the lake overlook to just above Horse Camp where I put on my snowshoes. It was warm and sunny so most of my extra clothing stayed in the pack.',\n",

       " 24: 'This was one of those hikes where my humans should have turned around.  Although it was warm (~50 degrees) at the trailhead, it was snowing quite hard at the top.  The trail had some obstacles near the top and the trail was icy/snow covered near the summit.  More than once my humans looked confused and said something like, \"let\\'s just follow Trixie, she seems to know the way\".  Well lucky for them, I\\'m quite the GPS system.  I led them over the top and across the ridge.  After about a mile I picked up the trail on the downside of the loop and all was calm again.  We should have turned around before the summit when we encountered the deadfall and heavy snow, but my humans had summit fever so we hiked right into a cluster.  I don\\'t think they could have down climbed the way we came up without a rope.  This is the only time I have questioned their judgement on a hike, but you should be wary of this hike in the winter if you are not smarter than my humans.  Having said this, the hike was really isolated, great exercise and I loved my summit sandwich.  See you on the trail.  I also think that the trail is 8.2 miles with the loop at the top.  The trailhead indicates it is 1.8 miles to the loop, 4.6 miles around the loop, and if you want to return to the car you must hike the 1.8 miles back.This was my first hike up to Mount Rose, and it was great! It snowed or rained most of the day, so views at the top weren\\'t too vast, but I\\'ll definitely return for a repeat. Snow began to cover the trail around 1900 to 2000\\'. Around that level, we put on microspikes since it was a bit icy and slick in the morning. There wasn\\'t enough snow coverage for snowshoes until the halfway point between Horse Camp and the summit (I\\'d guess 3700\\'). After that, we followed some tracks that, according to my GPS, sent us up right in between the two trails that form a loop to the summit. I would estimate about 5 to 6 feet of snow in open places near the top. In the trees, it\\'s a bit compacted, so there might not be that much everywhere. Summit conditions were cold and windy, though that was the only place where wind was an issue.',\n",

We were able to climb over a littler higher upstream but my lil canine buddy was not thrilled. Carrying him over would have risked injury, so we turned back just shy of the summit.

No mile in the ascent has less than 1200 feet of gain in it so it is relentless. On a clear day you get full Cascade mountain views and you have Mt Ellinor front and center. Saturday there was a low cloud layer so we could make out Mt Adams, but only Ellinor was really worth taking pictures of. We used the lollipop ridge route down which adds 1/2 mile and eases the steepness some on the descent to Horse Camp. More story and pictures here. http://hikemindedpeople.blo[…]-rose-relentless-grade.htmlNo bugs but, some kind of beehive on the right fork of the summit loop.

       " 46: \"Hiked the Mount Rose trail today. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the road to the trailhead is very rough, especially if you have a low clearance vehicle. However, it's only bad for about the last half mile to the trailhead, so its not too bad of a nuisance overall. Began hiking at 830 with only two other vehicles at the trailhead, it was very quiet on the way up which was nice to hear birds chirping and such. I reached the summit loop start point and strapped on some yak tracks and started to get after it! Made it about a 1/4 mile using taking the left loop before I decided to turn back. The snow was packed, but a lot of it was pretty loose which led to many postholes. Would definitely recommend snow shoes and a trail map as it was easy for me to get off course in the snow. Overall a great day outside and a very challenging hike for your legs!Parking lot is pretty small but more space on the road below. Beautiful switchback trail for the first two miles. At the fork both ways lead to the summit but the left one is shorter. We the right one on the way up and on the way down took the shorter one. Both start snow around .3 from the fork. Friend used microspikes but I didn’t and was fine. Views on top are nice.\",\n",

       " 49: \"I took a group of our high school's Hiking Club members on this trail today, and although it was cold and even snowed/hailed at the top it was a great hike!\\r The top of the trail is still covered in snow for about the last half mile, and the snow is about 5 feet deep in a lot of places. It's compacted, though, so you can walk on it without post holing and snowshoes definitely aren't needed. Micro spikes would have been helpful, but they aren't necessary either if you don't mind sliding a bit. The trail is also fairly easy to find so long as you follow footprints and the red markers hung in trees.  We took the left (shorter, steeper) side of the summit loop both on the way up and down, so I'm not sure about conditions on the other part of the loop.\\r The trail isn't in perfect condition -- there were several trees across the trail, a few places where the trail was a bit washed out, and the very last top section to the summit is a bit hard to follow. It's not like anyone would get lost or anything, but it's just not in the greatest shape. Overall it's a great hike though and the trail is definitely good enough if you don't mind spending an extra couple seconds making sure you're still on it.Parking lot is pretty small but more space on the road below.

       " 66: 'Beautiful day for a summit hike to Mt Rose.   Snow was hard packed and perfect for micro-spikes.  Found snow at 3000 feet. No wind and brilliant blue sky.  This was one of those hikes where my humans should have turned around.  Although it was warm (~50 degrees) at the trailhead, it was snowing quite hard at the top.  The trail had some obstacles near the top and the trail was icy/snow covered near the summit.  More than once my humans looked confused and said something like, \"let\\'s just follow Trixie, she seems to know the way\".  Well lucky for them, I\\'m quite the GPS system.  I led them over the top and across the ridge.  After about a mile I picked up the trail on the downside of the loop and all was calm again.  We should have turned around before the summit when we encountered the deadfall and heavy snow, but my humans had summit fever so we hiked right into a cluster.  I don\\'t think they could have down climbed the way we came up without a rope.  This is the only time I have questioned their judgement on a hike, but you should be wary of this hike in the winter if you are not smarter than my humans.  Having said this, the hike was really isolated, great exercise and I loved my summit sandwich.  See you on the trail.  I also think that the trail is 8.2 miles with the loop at the top.  The trailhead indicates it is 1.8 miles to the loop, 4.6 miles around the loop, and if you want to return to the car you must hike the 1.8 miles back.',\n",

The trailhead parking was almost full when I got there at 2:30pm, and several cars were parked along the road below.From the signed junction, I followed the shorter (and slightly more rooty and rocky) trail up, and the longer trail down. The trails were in good condition, apart from one or two larger blowdowns.Even though part of this forest burned a few years ago, the trail remained under tree cover for most of the way up--a good thing on a warm day. The longer trail crossed several small streams.Encountered a couple of parties on he trail, but no one at the summit. Some wildflowers were blooming.

       " 80: \"No Snow!!!!!!!!!!!!This was a beautiful hike and a rare one with no snow this year.Gaining 1000 ft./mile, this is a steady climb through salal, Oregon grape and Douglas Fir, then into stands of cedar, an occasional tiger lily, and peek-a-boo glances at Lake Cushman. Moving through various zones, toward the top there is a hillside of brilliant red columbine, yarrow, paintbrush,.... At the top--lupine, beargrass, purple penstamon and I think avalanche lily. Yesterday the clouds and mist surrounded me, so I didn't get the views from the top. It was more of the experience of being incredibly present on the mountain. Two key things--apparently one of the group of men who built and maintained this trail for years died last week. There is a plaque in honor of those folks at the loop junction. I stopped and sent out thanks and honor to those great people. Second, the loop to the summit gives you an option of going left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise). I took the left option, which seemed steeper. I was glad to have gone up the steeper part and come down the more gradual part, partly because of the slope, and partly for trailfinding. The trail is mostly clear and easy to follow, but there is a section through the burn at the top that was a bit sketchy. I felt more comfortable going up it (because I knew I was heading to the summit so I couldn't get lost) than down, where the options of direction become greater.

       " 96: \"Hiked the Mount Rose trail today. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the road to the trailhead is very rough, especially if you have a low clearance vehicle. However, it's only bad for about the last half mile to the trailhead, so its not too bad of a nuisance overall. Began hiking at 830 with only two other vehicles at the trailhead, it was very quiet on the way up which was nice to hear birds chirping and such. I reached the summit loop start point and strapped on some yak tracks and started to get after it! Made it about a 1/4 mile using taking the left loop before I decided to turn back. The snow was packed, but a lot of it was pretty loose which led to many postholes. Would definitely recommend snow shoes and a trail map as it was easy for me to get off course in the snow. Overall a great day outside and a very challenging hike for your legs!Parking lot is pretty small but more space on the road below. Beautiful switchback trail for the first two miles. At the fork both ways lead to the summit but the left one is shorter. We the right one on the way up and on the way down took the shorter one. Both start snow around .3 from the fork. Friend used microspikes but I didn’t and was fine. Views on top are nice.\",\n",

Cold weather made the snow nearly crampon-type hard but thankfully no postholing involved.

Don't under estimate this hike. The trail is in great shape. No dead fall to climb over or anything else blocking the path. A bit of the trail does have the brush encroaching but nothing impassable. No snow on the tail. But even with the great conditions the hike is steep, easily on the same scale as Mt Si.The trail has a few good stopping points on the way up to rest, all of which I used. The summit is not as clearly marked as some other hikes, so keep your eyes peeled for the top. The day's weather was great for a hike, nice cool light breeze. Happy to catch a break in the clouds during my lunch at the summit. Great view of Lake Cushman from the top. Definitely recommend starting the hike early and easing into it over the day.

Moving through various zones, toward the top there is a hillside of brilliant red columbine, yarrow, paintbrush,.... At the top--lupine, beargrass, purple penstamon and I think avalanche lily. Yesterday the clouds and mist surrounded me, so I didn't get the views from the top. It was more of the experience of being incredibly present on the mountain. Two key things--apparently one of the group of men who built and maintained this trail for years died last week. There is a plaque in honor of those folks at the loop junction. I stopped and sent out thanks and honor to those great people. Second, the loop to the summit gives you an option of going left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise). I took the left option, which seemed steeper. I was glad to have gone up the steeper part and come down the more gradual part, partly because of the slope, and partly for trailfinding. The trail is mostly clear and easy to follow, but there is a section through the burn at the top that was a bit sketchy. I felt more comfortable going up it (because I knew I was heading to the summit so I couldn't get lost) than down, where the options of direction become greater. I could be wrong on this because I didn't try it the other way, but... something to consider.At the bottom, a swim in the lake just can't be beat!Enjoy! This is a beautiful hike, a butt-burner, and one that my knees are paying for today. But it was well worth it!Short gravel road without potholes to the trailhead. The trailhead parking was almost full when I got there at 2:30pm, and several cars were parked along the road below.From the signed junction, I followed the shorter (and slightly more rooty and rocky) trail up, and the longer trail down. The trails were in good condition, apart from one or two larger blowdowns.Even though part of this forest burned a few years ago, the trail remained under tree cover for most of the way up--a good thing on a warm day. The longer trail crossed several small streams.Encountered a couple of parties on he trail, but no one at the summit. Some wildflowers were blooming. Didn't encounter any wildlife, other than a slug.Photos: http://picasaweb.google.com/eric.jain/MountRoseJuly2012Panorama: http://photosynth.net/view.[…]d923-4f1e-99f2-429c87b9c06dTracklog: http://connect.garmin.com/activity/202121078\",\n",

       " 136: \"Wonderful trail to the snowline at about 3400'.  Someone's been working hard making this trail an outstanding uphill walk.  I haven't visited here in several years and was impressed to see a sign at the fork distinguishing the summit (left) from the ridge route (right). We chose the left fork.  Once on the snow it was easy to follow with tape blazes and other footsteps, though several of the blazes have been removed.  Cold weather made the snow nearly crampon-type hard but thankfully no postholing involved. The stream crossing was a little tricky because of the hard snow and steep bank Ski poles came in handy here.  Fog at the top prevented seeing much but during one short break we got a glimpse of Ellinor.The good news is the road to Mount Rose has recently had fresh dirt and gravel put on it, so there are no potholes at this time. Snow level is at about 2500 feet. There are quite a few wet and slippery areas as the snow melts. We made it up to Horse Camp with no problems, but along the Summit Loop trail under the trees the snow is still deep. It quickly got to 3 feet and then even deeper. We brought snow shoes, but because the snow is starting to melt it was very wet and heavy. We still sunk in and and then they were heavy. We plodded along stepping slowly for awhile and then turned back. There was another single hiker who was postholing it with crampons on who went a bit farther that we did, but then she turned back also. The snow shoes were helpful on the way down not to slip on the wet snow. I recommend at least micro spikes along this section. The rest of the trail is in great shape, only a few small trees to step over.\",\n",
       " 137: \"Road = Last few miles of road very pot-holed. OK but still very bouncy in my Jeep 4WD. Wouldn’t recommend in a low car.\\r Trail = Very hard to follow on the summit loop once the snow covered the trail. We went right at the summit loop (counter clockwise, not clockwise). Trees were marked with orange diamonds and led us through the snow to the summit ridge, started left for a bit, and then the markers completely disappeared. We wandered around for a while, hiking up to what appeared to be the summit, and came across another group who were similarly lost. We opted to retrace our steps instead of keep looking for the rest of the loop, so we don’t know where the loop was supposed to connect.\\r Snow = Old snow very soon after where the summit loop started. Snow was very unpredictable and we randomly post-holed pretty frequently, gaiters recommended. Used microspikes and trekking poles, which were very helpful (for some reason, only on the way down; we didn’t stop on the way up).\\r Up and down in four hours at a fast pace. Trail is unrelentingly steep with very few rest spots. Sweat + cold rain made layering difficult. Windy once we got up on the summit ridge.Hiked up a very wet Mount Rose today with a group of Olympia Mountaineers. Sorry for the blurry photos - it was a super wet day and my GoPro was not having it!\\r The road has the usual potholes leading to the trailhead - use caution if you don't have a high clearance vehicle. The maintenance at the trailhead is complete, with room for about 10 cars. There is a port-a-john at the trailhead. \\r The trail is snow free all the way to Horse Camp. Shortly after leaving Horse Camp (we went left), you will encounter patches of snow. The snow builds gradually until you are walking in several feet of snow. Hard to tell exactly how deep it was, but it some areas it had to be at least 5 feet deep. The snow was packed down pretty well, and we did not need to use our snow shoes. However, we did put on micro spikes! There were a couple guys in the group that did not have them, and they were fine, but micro spikes definitely made the climb up and down much easier. \\r It took us 2.5 hours to reach the summit. Once we got there, it was extremely windy and cold and covered in clouds, so we only stayed about 15 minutes before heading back down the same way we came up. Right as we were leaving, the clouds broke and we could actually see Lake Cushman below. \\r All in all, it was a very wet, but not a bad day up Rose. It's a great conditioner hike that will have you back home in Olympia before 3pm. Can't beat that!\",\n",

There wasn't enough snow coverage for snowshoes until the halfway point between Horse Camp and the summit (I'd guess 3700'). After that, we followed some tracks that, according to my GPS, sent us up right in between the two trails that form a loop to the summit. I would estimate about 5 to 6 feet of snow in open places near the top. In the trees, it's a bit compacted, so there might not be that much everywhere. Summit conditions were cold and windy, though that was the only place where wind was an issue.\",\n",

No mile in the ascent has less than 1200 feet of gain in it so it is relentless. On a clear day you get full Cascade mountain views and you have Mt Ellinor front and center. Saturday there was a low cloud layer so we could make out Mt Adams, but only Ellinor was really worth taking pictures of. We used the lollipop ridge route down which adds 1/2 mile and eases the steepness some on the descent to Horse Camp.

Moving through various zones, toward the top there is a hillside of brilliant red columbine, yarrow, paintbrush,.... At the top--lupine, beargrass, purple penstamon and I think avalanche lily. Yesterday the clouds and mist surrounded me, so I didn't get the views from the top. It was more of the experience of being incredibly present on the mountain. Two key things--apparently one of the group of men who built and maintained this trail for years died last week. There is a plaque in honor of those folks at the loop junction. I stopped and sent out thanks and honor to those great people. Second, the loop to the summit gives you an option of going left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise). I took the left option, which seemed steeper. I was glad to have gone up the steeper part and come down the more gradual part, partly because of the slope, and partly for trailfinding. The trail is mostly clear and easy to follow, but there is a section through the burn at the top that was a bit sketchy. I felt more comfortable going up it (because I knew I was heading to the summit so I couldn't get lost) than down, where the options of direction become greater. I could be wrong on this because I didn't try it the other way, but... something to consider.At the bottom, a swim in the lake just can't be beat!Enjoy! This is a beautiful hike, a butt-burner, and one that my knees are paying for today. But it was well worth it!Short gravel road without potholes to the trailhead.

       " 162: \"No Snow!!!!!!!!!!!!This was a beautiful hike and a rare one with no snow this year.Gaining 1000 ft./mile, this is a steady climb through salal, Oregon grape and Douglas Fir, then into stands of cedar, an occasional tiger lily, and peek-a-boo glances at Lake Cushman. Moving through various zones, toward the top there is a hillside of brilliant red columbine, yarrow, paintbrush,.... At the top--lupine, beargrass, purple penstamon and I think avalanche lily. Yesterday the clouds and mist surrounded me, so I didn't get the views from the top. It was more of the experience of being incredibly present on the mountain. Two key things--apparently one of the group of men who built and maintained this trail for years died last week. There is a plaque in honor of those folks at the loop junction. I stopped and sent out thanks and honor to those great people. Second, the loop to the summit gives you an option of going left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise). I took the left option, which seemed steeper. I was glad to have gone up the steeper part and come down the more gradual part, partly because of the slope, and partly for trailfinding. The trail is mostly clear and easy to follow, but there is a section through the burn at the top that was a bit sketchy. I felt more comfortable going up it (because I knew I was heading to the summit so I couldn't get lost) than down, where the options of direction become greater. I could be wrong on this because I didn't try it the other way, but... something to consider.At the bottom, a swim in the lake just can't be beat!Enjoy! This is a beautiful hike, a butt-burner, and one that my knees are paying for today. But it was well worth it!Short gravel road without potholes to the trailhead.

However, it's only bad for about the last half mile to the trailhead, so its not too bad of a nuisance overall. Began hiking at 830 with only two other vehicles at the trailhead, it was very quiet on the way up which was nice to hear birds chirping and such. I reached the summit loop start point and strapped on some yak tracks and started to get after it! Made it about a 1/4 mile using taking the left loop before I decided to turn back. The snow was packed, but a lot of it was pretty loose which led to many postholes. Would definitely recommend snow shoes and a trail map as it was easy for me to get off course in the snow. Overall a great day outside and a very challenging hike for your legs!Parking lot is pretty small but more space on the road below. Beautiful switchback trail for the first two miles. At the fork both ways lead to the summit but the left one is shorter. We the right one on the way up and on the way down took the shorter one. Both start snow around .3 from the fork.

One side of the loop did have snow on it but didn't require equipment to get through.The good news is the road to Mount Rose has recently had fresh dirt and gravel put on it, so there are no potholes at this time. Snow level is at about 2500 feet. There are quite a few wet and slippery areas as the snow melts. We made it up to Horse Camp with no problems, but along the Summit Loop trail under the trees the snow is still deep. It quickly got to 3 feet and then even deeper. We brought snow shoes, but because the snow is starting to melt it was very wet and heavy. We still sunk in and and then they were heavy. We plodded along stepping slowly for awhile and then turned back. There was another single hiker who was postholing it with crampons on who went a bit farther that we did, but then she turned back also. The snow shoes were helpful on the way down not to slip on the wet snow. I recommend at least micro spikes along this section. The rest of the trail is in great shape, only a few small trees to step over.\",\n",

Wouldn’t recommend in a low car.\\r Trail = Very hard to follow on the summit loop once the snow covered the trail. We went right at the summit loop (counter clockwise, not clockwise). Trees were marked with orange diamonds and led us through the snow to the summit ridge, started left for a bit, and then the markers completely disappeared. We wandered around for a while, hiking up to what appeared to be the summit, and came across another group who were similarly lost. We opted to retrace our steps instead of keep looking for the rest of the loop, so we don’t know where the loop was supposed to connect.\\r Snow = Old snow very soon after where the summit loop started. Snow was very unpredictable and we randomly post-holed pretty frequently, gaiters recommended. Used microspikes and trekking poles, which were very helpful (for some reason, only on the way down; we didn’t stop on the way up).\\r Up and down in four hours at a fast pace. Trail is unrelentingly steep with very few rest spots. Sweat + cold rain made layering difficult. Windy once we got up on the summit ridge.Hiked up a very wet Mount Rose today with a group of Olympia Mountaineers. Sorry for the blurry photos - it was a super wet day and my GoPro was not having it!\\r The road has the usual potholes leading to the trailhead - use caution if you don't have a high clearance vehicle. The maintenance at the trailhead is complete, with room for about 10 cars. There is a port-a-john at the trailhead. \\r The trail is snow free all the way to Horse Camp. Shortly after leaving Horse Camp (we went left), you will encounter patches of snow. The snow builds gradually until you are walking in several feet of snow. Hard to tell exactly how deep it was, but it some areas it had to be at least 5 feet deep. The snow was packed down pretty well, and we did not need to use our snow shoes. However, we did put on micro spikes! There were a couple guys in the group that did not have them, and they were fine, but micro spikes definitely made the climb up and down much easier. \\r It took us 2.5 hours to reach the summit. Once we got there, it was extremely windy and cold and covered in clouds, so we only stayed about 15 minutes before heading back down the same way we came up. Right as we were leaving, the clouds broke and we could actually see Lake Cushman below. \\r All in all, it was a very wet, but not a bad day up Rose. It's a great conditioner hike that will have you back home in Olympia before 3pm. Can't beat that!\",\n",

We were able to climb over a littler higher upstream but my lil canine buddy was not thrilled. Carrying him over would have risked injury, so we turned back just shy of the summit. If you don't have a dog or little ones, the trail is fine for now!\\nBe sure to wear lots of layers---it is CHILLY up there!\\n\\xa0\",\n",
       " 181: 'My last hike on my first time \"to hike\" list from the start of the year (I\\'ve since added many more to tackle). This is a great hike and I enjoyed the tall trees and the steep incline. The days are getting shorter but decided to head up on a Thursday thinking it might be the last sunny day for a while. Didn\\'t see another person on the trail. It was quiet and the forest seemed to be pretty dark even for 3pm. Got to the summit and watched as the sun approached the top of the mountains. Watched a hawk fly over head. Enjoyed the fall foliage dance in the breeze and the warmth of the sun on my face. Savored the moment and then headed down prepared to arrive back to the vehicle in the dark. Headlamp on, the moon bright in the sky. I caught sight of some large frogs/toads on and off the trail. Currently, there is no water source on the trail beyond that found at the trailhead., so bring your water for the duration of the hike. The maps showed water source but they seem to be dry.Not your normal walk in the woods. Don\\'t under estimate this hike. The trail is in great shape. No dead fall to climb over or anything else blocking the path. A bit of the trail does have the brush encroaching but nothing impassable. No snow on the tail. But even with the great conditions the hike is steep, easily on the same scale as Mt Si.The trail has a few good stopping points on the way up to rest, all of which I used. The summit is not as clearly marked as some other hikes, so keep your eyes peeled for the top. The day\\'s weather was great for a hike, nice cool light breeze. Happy to catch a break in the clouds during my lunch at the summit. Great view of Lake Cushman from the top. Definitely recommend starting the hike early and easing into it over the day. Moving at a good pace total time up and down was 4 hrs 10 min, including stops and lunch.',\n",

Took us 3 hours up and 2 hours down.  there were a lot of bugs but they only really bothered us when we stopped for a break.  There is a bees nest on the left half of the loop but they really did not bother us.  The gal with her dog in front of us both got stung though!  It's a ground nest on your right about .2 miles into the left leg.  Definitely worth the effort though the views from the top were breathtaking and we were all alone.  No permit needed and there is a porta potty at the trailhead.  There is also close access to the lake right across the street.  You will need it when you get done!!Never Skip Leg Day!

       " 186: \"FR 24 to Staircase opened Monday so a few of us went out Thursday to see how Staircase & the Mt. Rose trail survived the winter. FR 24 is in good shape with mild potholes in the gravel section. The road is open all the way to Staircase. The landslides were large and creek have carved fresh channels. The damage is worse as you get closer to the park. The park ranger said some Staircase trails are damaged including the north fork trail at the Beaver Burn. Wagonwheel Lake and Staircase rapids are ok.The lower Mount Rose trail is in great shape thanks to years of hard work by the Mount Rose Trail Crew. We started up in a gray morning. Thunder rumbled, getting louder and more frequent as we went. We did see one flash towards Hood Canal. At the spur to the falls we decided the lightning wasn't too close so we kept going. At Horse Camp we took the right fork. There were occasional downs to step over. At 3700ft we ran into a large blowdown area about 100 yards long. The orange blazes helped us pick our way through to the trail on the other side. We made our way along the dips on the ridge and popped out on top at the summit outcrop. It was a strange scene. We had come out of lush forest and flowers and north side of the summit was green. But below the outcrop and the south side side of the summit was heavily burned. By this time the thunder had stopped and the sun came out for lunch. We enjoyed views of Lake Cushman, Copper Mountain, Mount Eleanor and up the valley towards Home Sweet Home.On the way down we ran into large patches of downs and fire obscured trail. At the trailhead signs warn to stay off this leg in the rain. It's easy to see how the burn is prone to slides. Below the burn we ran into firm patchy snow all the way down to 3400 feet. Patience kept us on the trail through these obstacles. If you're not familiar with the trail take your time. The off trail terrain is steep and there are cliffs nearby. Once below the snow the trail was great back to Horse Camp. We enjoyed the forest flowers on the steep trail back to the car.

The longer route to the summit is easier to follow so I took it up this time and took the shorter route down. I still lost the trail on the way down but thanks to my GPS track log from earlier this week I found the trail again right away.The tree with the sign that says \"\"no stoves beyond this point\"\" has fallen down.http://mosswalks.blogspot.com for bigger pictures.We tried to climb Mt.

       " 192: 'WOW! I felt this Rose of a trail for DAYS after. Gosh my quads were so sore 3-4 days after (but probably because I did it without any breaks and jogged it down). I hiked this one solo over Memorial Weekend. There were plenty of hikers on the trail throughout. I left at 1:00 and made it up 46 switchbacks (not that I was counting) an hour later to the split for the loop up Rose. I veered left and made it up to the submit in another 40 minutes and about 53 switchbacks later (I might have missed a few in an attempt to keep breathing--made it without taking a break!). The top was crowded so I want back down about 150 feet to a nice boulder that still had a great view of Rainier and the surrounding area. \\r Feeling ambitious--or rather feeling less pain in my knees jogging down then walking--I continued the loop around and headed back down. I made it to the split in 24 minutes then down in half an hour. Again jogging most of the time because walking was unbearably painful for my long legged limbs. \\r Awesome hike, definitely a thorn in the legs up and down, but a Rose of a view at the top.I headed out and when I made a wrong turn on some road I saw the trail head and decided to go up it. I got kinda a late start for not knowing where I was going, or to where the trail lead. I was planning on staying the night, so when night fell I would just find a place to set up my hammock at, re hydrate some food and kick back and read a book while enjoying the great outdoors.The trail was in excelent condition. It almsot seemed to be too good. It was steep, and there was quite a few switchbacks, but I guess thats what you get for doing a trail that starts with \"\"Mt.\"\" It was nothing that I couldn\\'t handle. It was a overcast day, so the view wasn\\'t all that good, but I could see Lake Cushman off and on.I got to the big rock... I think where the trail junction in. I sat down to take a break and while doing so realized that I forgot a few of the items that I have always been taught to check, and double check before you start out. Matches and Toliet Paper. So... I decided to head back down. I can live with out matches but the toliet paper... :) I was able to jog most of the way down make some good time. Using my treking poles to round the steep corners with out having to slow down much.All in all it was a good hike, even though I was unable to make it to the top. I am going to have to go back in about a week and try again.',\n",
       " 193: \"Very steep switchbacks up to the summit loop but the trail is in very good condition. One side of the loop did have snow on it but didn't require equipment to get through.The good news is the road to Mount Rose has recently had fresh dirt and gravel put on it, so there are no potholes at this time. Snow level is at about 2500 feet. There are quite a few wet and slippery areas as the snow melts. We made it up to Horse Camp with no problems, but along the Summit Loop trail under the trees the snow is still deep. It quickly got to 3 feet and then even deeper. We brought snow shoes, but because the snow is starting to melt it was very wet and heavy. We still sunk in and and then they were heavy. We plodded along stepping slowly for awhile and then turned back. There was another single hiker who was postholing it with crampons on who went a bit farther that we did, but then she turned back also. The snow shoes were helpful on the way down not to slip on the wet snow. I recommend at least micro spikes along this section. The rest of the trail is in great shape, only a few small trees to step over.\",\n",

Even this time I had to break trail from my previous high point to the summit. Rose in winter is safer and easier than trying to do Ellinor and gives you about the same vertical climb. I needed microspikes from the lake overlook to just above Horse Camp where I put on my snowshoes. It was warm and sunny so most of my extra clothing stayed in the pack.Hiked up to Horse Camp on Mount Rose today, came down and repeated to get 5k elevation without having to deal with route finding or snow shoes. Typical misty day until 2500\\' when the rain turned to snow, and snow started\\xa0to accumulate on the trail. Kicking steps by 2700\\', about 9\" to a foot at horse camp. One other party ahead of me breaking trail, they turned around soon after starting the loop. Nice day outside!\\n\\xa0',\n",
       " 195: 'This was one of those hikes where my humans should have turned around.  Although it was warm (~50 degrees) at the trailhead, it was snowing quite hard at the top.  The trail had some obstacles near the top and the trail was icy/snow covered near the summit.  More than once my humans looked confused and said something like, \"let\\'s just follow Trixie, she seems to know the way\".  Well lucky for them, I\\'m quite the GPS system.  I led them over the top and across the ridge.  After about a mile I picked up the trail on the downside of the loop and all was calm again.  We should have turned around before the summit when we encountered the deadfall and heavy snow, but my humans had summit fever so we hiked right into a cluster.  I don\\'t think they could have down climbed the way we came up without a rope.  This is the only time I have questioned their judgement on a hike, but you should be wary of this hike in the winter if you are not smarter than my humans.  Having said this, the hike was really isolated, great exercise and I loved my summit sandwich.  See you on the trail.  I also think that the trail is 8.2 miles with the loop at the top.  The trailhead indicates it is 1.8 miles to the loop, 4.6 miles around the loop, and if you want to return to the car you must hike the 1.8 miles back.This was my first hike up to Mount Rose, and it was great! It snowed or rained most of the day, so views at the top weren\\'t too vast, but I\\'ll definitely return for a repeat. Snow began to cover the trail around 1900 to 2000\\'. Around that level, we put on microspikes since it was a bit icy and slick in the morning. There wasn\\'t enough snow coverage for snowshoes until the halfway point between Horse Camp and the summit (I\\'d guess 3700\\'). After that, we followed some tracks that, according to my GPS, sent us up right in between the two trails that form a loop to the summit. I would estimate about 5 to 6 feet of snow in open places near the top. In the trees, it\\'s a bit compacted, so there might not be that much everywhere.

The trail had some obstacles near the top and the trail was icy/snow covered near the summit.  More than once my humans looked confused and said something like, \"let\\'s just follow Trixie, she seems to know the way\".  Well lucky for them, I\\'m quite the GPS system.  I led them over the top and across the ridge.  After about a mile I picked up the trail on the downside of the loop and all was calm again.  We should have turned around before the summit when we encountered the deadfall and heavy snow, but my humans had summit fever so we hiked right into a cluster.  I don\\'t think they could have down climbed the way we came up without a rope.  This is the only time I have questioned their judgement on a hike, but you should be wary of this hike in the winter if you are not smarter than my humans.  Having said this, the hike was really isolated, great exercise and I loved my summit sandwich.  See you on the trail.  I also think that the trail is 8.2 miles with the loop at the top.  The trailhead indicates it is 1.8 miles to the loop, 4.6 miles around the loop, and if you want to return to the car you must hike the 1.8 miles back.This was my first hike up to Mount Rose, and it was great! It snowed or rained most of the day, so views at the top weren\\'t too vast, but I\\'ll definitely return for a repeat. Snow began to cover the trail around 1900 to 2000\\'. Around that level, we put on microspikes since it was a bit icy and slick in the morning. There wasn\\'t enough snow coverage for snowshoes until the halfway point between Horse Camp and the summit (I\\'d guess 3700\\'). After that, we followed some tracks that, according to my GPS, sent us up right in between the two trails that form a loop to the summit. I would estimate about 5 to 6 feet of snow in open places near the top. In the trees, it\\'s a bit compacted, so there might not be that much everywhere. Summit conditions were cold and windy, though that was the only place where wind was an issue.',\n",

The longer route to the summit is easier to follow so I took it up this time and took the shorter route down. I still lost the trail on the way down but thanks to my GPS track log from earlier this week I found the trail again right away.The tree with the sign that says \"\"no stoves beyond this point\"\" has fallen down.http://mosswalks.blogspot.com for bigger pictures.We tried to climb Mt.

However, it's only bad for about the last half mile to the trailhead, so its not too bad of a nuisance overall. Began hiking at 830 with only two other vehicles at the trailhead, it was very quiet on the way up which was nice to hear birds chirping and such. I reached the summit loop start point and strapped on some yak tracks and started to get after it! Made it about a 1/4 mile using taking the left loop before I decided to turn back. The snow was packed, but a lot of it was pretty loose which led to many postholes. Would definitely recommend snow shoes and a trail map as it was easy for me to get off course in the snow. Overall a great day outside and a very challenging hike for your legs!Parking lot is pretty small but more space on the road below. Beautiful switchback trail for the first two miles. At the fork both ways lead to the summit but the left one is shorter. We the right one on the way up and on the way down took the shorter one. Both start snow around .3 from the fork.

No mile in the ascent has less than 1200 feet of gain in it so it is relentless. On a clear day you get full Cascade mountain views and you have Mt Ellinor front and center. Saturday there was a low cloud layer so we could make out Mt Adams, but only Ellinor was really worth taking pictures of. We used the lollipop ridge route down which adds 1/2 mile and eases the steepness some on the descent to Horse Camp.

Savored the moment and then headed down prepared to arrive back to the vehicle in the dark. Headlamp on, the moon bright in the sky. I caught sight of some large frogs/toads on and off the trail. Currently, there is no water source on the trail beyond that found at the trailhead., so bring your water for the duration of the hike. The maps showed water source but they seem to be dry.Great workout, good hike, and trail is in good shape. Overcast and no visibility for lake views, but it was cool for the hike.',\n",

However, it's only bad for about the last half mile to the trailhead, so its not too bad of a nuisance overall. Began hiking at 830 with only two other vehicles at the trailhead, it was very quiet on the way up which was nice to hear birds chirping and such. I reached the summit loop start point and strapped on some yak tracks and started to get after it! Made it about a 1/4 mile using taking the left loop before I decided to turn back. The snow was packed, but a lot of it was pretty loose which led to many postholes. Would definitely recommend snow shoes and a trail map as it was easy for me to get off course in the snow. Overall a great day outside and a very challenging hike for your legs!Parking lot is pretty small but more space on the road below. Beautiful switchback trail for the first two miles. At the fork both ways lead to the summit but the left one is shorter. We the right one on the way up and on the way down took the shorter one. Both start snow around .3 from the fork. Friend used microspikes but I didn’t and was fine. Views on top are nice.\",\n",

FR 24 is in good shape with mild potholes in the gravel section. The road is open all the way to Staircase. The landslides were large and creek have carved fresh channels. The damage is worse as you get closer to the park. The park ranger said some Staircase trails are damaged including the north fork trail at the Beaver Burn. Wagonwheel Lake and Staircase rapids are ok.The lower Mount Rose trail is in great shape thanks to years of hard work by the Mount Rose Trail Crew. We started up in a gray morning. Thunder rumbled, getting louder and more frequent as we went. We did see one flash towards Hood Canal. At the spur to the falls we decided the lightning wasn't too close so we kept going. At Horse Camp we took the right fork. There were occasional downs to step over. At 3700ft we ran into a large blowdown area about 100 yards long. The orange blazes helped us pick our way through to the trail on the other side. We made our way along the dips on the ridge and popped out on top at the summit outcrop. It was a strange scene. We had come out of lush forest and flowers and north side of the summit was green. But below the outcrop and the south side side of the summit was heavily burned. By this time the thunder had stopped and the sun came out for lunch. We enjoyed views of Lake Cushman, Copper Mountain, Mount Eleanor and up the valley towards Home Sweet Home.On the way down we ran into large patches of downs and fire obscured trail. At the trailhead signs warn to stay off this leg in the rain. It's easy to see how the burn is prone to slides. Below the burn we ran into firm patchy snow all the way down to 3400 feet. Patience kept us on the trail through these obstacles. If you're not familiar with the trail take your time. The off trail terrain is steep and there are cliffs nearby. Once below the snow the trail was great back to Horse Camp. We enjoyed the forest flowers on the steep trail back to the car.

Took us 3 hours up and 2 hours down.  there were a lot of bugs but they only really bothered us when we stopped for a break.  There is a bees nest on the left half of the loop but they really did not bother us.  The gal with her dog in front of us both got stung though!  It's a ground nest on your right about .2 miles into the left leg.  Definitely worth the effort though the views from the top were breathtaking and we were all alone.  No permit needed and there is a porta potty at the trailhead.  There is also close access to the lake right across the street.  You will need it when you get done!!Never Skip Leg Day! This was an incredible hike, loved it, great views, well worth the effort you have to put in to reach the top.\",\n",
       " 237: \"No Snow!!!!!!!!!!!!This was a beautiful hike and a rare one with no snow this year.Gaining 1000 ft./mile, this is a steady climb through salal, Oregon grape and Douglas Fir, then into stands of cedar, an occasional tiger lily, and peek-a-boo glances at Lake Cushman. Moving through various zones, toward the top there is a hillside of brilliant red columbine, yarrow, paintbrush,.... At the top--lupine, beargrass, purple penstamon and I think avalanche lily. Yesterday the clouds and mist surrounded me, so I didn't get the views from the top. It was more of the experience of being incredibly present on the mountain. Two key things--apparently one of the group of men who built and maintained this trail for years died last week. There is a plaque in honor of those folks at the loop junction. I stopped and sent out thanks and honor to those great people. Second, the loop to the summit gives you an option of going left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise). I took the left option, which seemed steeper. I was glad to have gone up the steeper part and come down the more gradual part, partly because of the slope, and partly for trailfinding. The trail is mostly clear and easy to follow, but there is a section through the burn at the top that was a bit sketchy. I felt more comfortable going up it (because I knew I was heading to the summit so I couldn't get lost) than down, where the options of direction become greater. I could be wrong on this because I didn't try it the other way, but... something to consider.At the bottom, a swim in the lake just can't be beat!Enjoy! This is a beautiful hike, a butt-burner, and one that my knees are paying for today. But it was well worth it!Short gravel road without potholes to the trailhead. The trailhead parking was almost full when I got there at 2:30pm, and several cars were parked along the road below.From the signed junction, I followed the shorter (and slightly more rooty and rocky) trail up, and the longer trail down. The trails were in good condition, apart from one or two larger blowdowns.Even though part of this forest burned a few years ago, the trail remained under tree cover for most of the way up--a good thing on a warm day. The longer trail crossed several small streams.Encountered a couple of parties on he trail, but no one at the summit. Some wildflowers were blooming. Didn't encounter any wildlife, other than a slug.Photos: http://picasaweb.google.com/eric.jain/MountRoseJuly2012Panorama: http://photosynth.net/view.[…]d923-4f1e-99f2-429c87b9c06dTracklog: http://connect.garmin.com/activity/202121078\",\n",

The trail had some obstacles near the top and the trail was icy/snow covered near the summit.  More than once my humans looked confused and said something like, \"let\\'s just follow Trixie, she seems to know the way\".  Well lucky for them, I\\'m quite the GPS system.  I led them over the top and across the ridge.  After about a mile I picked up the trail on the downside of the loop and all was calm again.  We should have turned around before the summit when we encountered the deadfall and heavy snow, but my humans had summit fever so we hiked right into a cluster.  I don\\'t think they could have down climbed the way we came up without a rope.  This is the only time I have questioned their judgement on a hike, but you should be wary of this hike in the winter if you are not smarter than my humans.  Having said this, the hike was really isolated, great exercise and I loved my summit sandwich.  See you on the trail.  I also think that the trail is 8.2 miles with the loop at the top.  The trailhead indicates it is 1.8 miles to the loop, 4.6 miles around the loop, and if you want to return to the car you must hike the 1.8 miles back.This was my first hike up to Mount Rose, and it was great! It snowed or rained most of the day, so views at the top weren\\'t too vast, but I\\'ll definitely return for a repeat. Snow began to cover the trail around 1900 to 2000\\'. Around that level, we put on microspikes since it was a bit icy and slick in the morning. There wasn\\'t enough snow coverage for snowshoes until the halfway point between Horse Camp and the summit (I\\'d guess 3700\\'). After that, we followed some tracks that, according to my GPS, sent us up right in between the two trails that form a loop to the summit. I would estimate about 5 to 6 feet of snow in open places near the top. In the trees, it\\'s a bit compacted, so there might not be that much everywhere.

No mile in the ascent has less than 1200 feet of gain in it so it is relentless. On a clear day you get full Cascade mountain views and you have Mt Ellinor front and center. Saturday there was a low cloud layer so we could make out Mt Adams, but only Ellinor was really worth taking pictures of. We used the lollipop ridge route down which adds 1/2 mile and eases the steepness some on the descent to Horse Camp.

Trees were marked with orange diamonds and led us through the snow to the summit ridge, started left for a bit, and then the markers completely disappeared. We wandered around for a while, hiking up to what appeared to be the summit, and came across another group who were similarly lost. We opted to retrace our steps instead of keep looking for the rest of the loop, so we don’t know where the loop was supposed to connect.\\r Snow = Old snow very soon after where the summit loop started. Snow was very unpredictable and we randomly post-holed pretty frequently, gaiters recommended. Used microspikes and trekking poles, which were very helpful (for some reason, only on the way down; we didn’t stop on the way up).\\r Up and down in four hours at a fast pace. Trail is unrelentingly steep with very few rest spots. Sweat + cold rain made layering difficult. Windy once we got up on the summit ridge.Hiked up a very wet Mount Rose today with a group of Olympia Mountaineers. Sorry for the blurry photos - it was a super wet day and my GoPro was not having it!\\r The road has the usual potholes leading to the trailhead - use caution if you don't have a high clearance vehicle. The maintenance at the trailhead is complete, with room for about 10 cars. There is a port-a-john at the trailhead. \\r The trail is snow free all the way to Horse Camp. Shortly after leaving Horse Camp (we went left), you will encounter patches of snow. The snow builds gradually until you are walking in several feet of snow. Hard to tell exactly how deep it was, but it some areas it had to be at least 5 feet deep. The snow was packed down pretty well, and we did not need to use our snow shoes. However, we did put on micro spikes! There were a couple guys in the group that did not have them, and they were fine, but micro spikes definitely made the climb up and down much easier. \\r It took us 2.5 hours to reach the summit. Once we got there, it was extremely windy and cold and covered in clouds, so we only stayed about 15 minutes before heading back down the same way we came up. Right as we were leaving, the clouds broke and we could actually see Lake Cushman below. \\r All in all, it was a very wet, but not a bad day up Rose.

Really just a dusting in places. As we continued to the second bridge, along the Upper Dungeness River the trail is rockier and there were several frozen/icy areas from runoff that had frozen over. We brought mico-spikes but never used them. We used our poles instead to navigate over the slick areas. A little more snow here, but not more than 1/2 inch.

The trail is in fine condition all the way to the lake. The trip to Mink Lake is 5 miles round trip and has a stealthy 1,500 feet of gain. Most of the time you don't realize the trail is all that steep, but the need for regular water breaks told me otherwise.The forest is beautiful and there are hundreds of Queen's Cup Lillies and Bunchberry flowers in bloom. For the vigilant, Western Coralroot orchids and Indian Pipe are also making an appearance. Beargrass, Anenomes and a type of violet are in bloom around the lake.Upon arriving at Mink Lake, we quickly became a moving buffet for the local mosquito population which is gathering in force around this marshy alpine pool. We stayed for a short while marvelling at the silence and the unbroken stands of trees that surrounded us on all sides. Our patience for mosquito encounters wore thin so we departed back into the shelter of the forest. On the way down, we studied the intricate patterns of roots, flora and other wonders of a healthy forest. A special note - on the day we were hiking, there were dozens of volunteers and rangers conducting a search for a hiker that had been missing for 4 days. We encountered two volunteers who were helping in the effort. One of them had been camping next to Mink Lake and sat next to a trail junction for 3 days talking with everyone that came by and watching for the missing hiker. The tale ends happily as the hiker eventually emerged from the forest far from where she had started. This encounter provided an important reminder that we should all be careful on our adventures into the wild and should be deeply grateful that there are phenomenal people out there who are willing to give of their personal time to help those who go astray. Thank you to all Search & Rescue folks out there that help us find our way home safely.My brother and I took a way trail from Camp Handy on the Dungeness, up and over the ridge to the summit of Petunia Peak. We then traversed the ridge under cliff bands in attempt to make it to upper Royal Basin. The traverse is do-able following below the cliff bands on the Royal side, but this terrain is not for beginners. I was fine and would have likely made it to upper Royal basin, but my brother was not comfortable with the steep terrain, so we ended up bailing out to Royal Lake. If you head down the scree slope and veer left, you can enter the wood line and pick up old trails and end up on the upper side of the lake. I would not attempt the Petunia Summit from the lower meadow/Royal basin side as the climbers guide suggests. It is much prettier and easier looking if you approach from the Dungeness , and you won't have to climb up 2000' of scree in the hot sun. As far as the summit itself; there seems to be many routes up. You shouldn't have any trouble once you near the summit block. We took the east facing side, up a snow field and around some rock bands to the west side and up the chute; leaving our packs near the pass that could take you down to the lower meadow. Took me about 10-15 min down from the summit. Let me know if you have any questions!\",\n",

There are almost a dozen trees that are over the trail, requiring a chain saw. All trees encountered can be easily climbed over or ducked under. One creek drainage right before the big wash-out area has massive erosion from recent heavy rains. The trail is slightly washed out and you must climb through loose rocks & mud to traverse the small creek. Once you approach the edge of the huge wash-out, you can clearly see the newly built WTA trail crossing the slide area. The old trail above looks very treacherous and it\\'s no wonder an alternative trail needed to be made. The new lower WTA trail is in fair condition, the recent heavy rains have washed deep crevices in the trail, making the rock pathway loose with large gaps. The washout area is passable, but extreme caution should be taken. I witnessed many small rocks tumbling down from high above while traversing the slide area. The rest of the trail was pleasant and about an inch of snow was present at the old look-out. I ran into 3 separate parties hiking up on my way down. This is great trail for seeing some very impressive views! I hope that someday the problem areas can be fixed long term for safety.Fun day hike with small dog and a friend, but very wet and snowy.

Where the trail splits right before KN lookout spot it was impossible to discern one of the trails with the thick snow.

As we gained elevation the landscape changed into a sub-alpine wonderland of meadows and blueberry bushed (full of berries and not yet red).We chased one plump bear and were too noisy from then on too have any further sightings.The summit was a little disappointing as it was heavily forested and allowed no views. Without the ridge to shelter us the very strong and chilling wind forced us to head down without staying long.(We were later told, in the comfort of the hottest pool, that hiking up another 5-10 minutes would have gotten us the views we missed.)As we started down the clouds started to gather and it was seriously raining by the time we got back to Mink Lake. It was difficult to image we were on the same trail. On the way up: Sun filtering through towering firs with wisps of mist.On the way down: Uniform grey light, rain dripping down onto a carpet of moss that seemed to glow from within.While relaxing later in the pools, listening to languages and accents from all over the planet, I couldn\\'t help but think how lucky we are to have this wonderful place so close.Trail clear of blowdown and passable to stock to Little Divide junction.',\n",

The tale ends happily as the hiker eventually emerged from the forest far from where she had started. This encounter provided an important reminder that we should all be careful on our adventures into the wild and should be deeply grateful that there are phenomenal people out there who are willing to give of their personal time to help those who go astray. Thank you to all Search & Rescue folks out there that help us find our way home safely.My brother and I took a way trail from Camp Handy on the Dungeness, up and over the ridge to the summit of Petunia Peak. We then traversed the ridge under cliff bands in attempt to make it to upper Royal Basin. The traverse is do-able following below the cliff bands on the Royal side, but this terrain is not for beginners. I was fine and would have likely made it to upper Royal basin, but my brother was not comfortable with the steep terrain, so we ended up bailing out to Royal Lake. If you head down the scree slope and veer left, you can enter the wood line and pick up old trails and end up on the upper side of the lake. I would not attempt the Petunia Summit from the lower meadow/Royal basin side as the climbers guide suggests. It is much prettier and easier looking if you approach from the Dungeness , and you won't have to climb up 2000' of scree in the hot sun. As far as the summit itself; there seems to be many routes up. You shouldn't have any trouble once you near the summit block. We took the east facing side, up a snow field and around some rock bands to the west side and up the chute; leaving our packs near the pass that could take you down to the lower meadow. Took me about 10-15 min down from the summit. Let me know if you have any questions!\",\n",

We are Mountaineers and have dealt with much exposure, but even if we had our helmets, it is not worth the risk. It\\'s all so loose and the passing is very narrow. Even a small rock can knock you off track and a fall there could easily kill you or at least seriously injure. Just for some pretty views? Or pretty views never again...It probably needs to be blasted before the new passing can be carved. If we had more time we would have tried to bushwhack it above or below the slide. Would need to refer to the topography.What a great hike!  I did this hike the day before a WTA crew went up there to clean it up a bit. There were a lot of downed trees and the slide area is dangerous to cross up top but is fine below.  From what I heard they cleaned it up pretty good.  The trail was snow free up until 2.5 miles or so and then you encounter maybe 8-10\" of snow for the last mile or so.

The section heading toward the road into Mora was OK, but boring, and a couple of trees down made it more trouble than it was worth. \\r The James Pond is an OK side trip or add-on from the parking area near the entrance, but today it was just ten more minutes in the wet.\",\n",
       " 330: \"After hiking Rialto Beach, we drove inland to Mora Campground and hiked Quillayute River Slough trail near the Olympic National Park entrance sign. Park at the ranger station. It was a quiet hike (we only came across a couple other hikers) and enjoyed a nice forest walk. There were some brief views of the river nearby but overall we spent time admiring the big trees, moss, and lichen along the trail. We also heard some interesting birds including possibly an owl. It is a very easy walk. It was rainy when we hiked it so watch out for some muddy spots if it's raining.This is a good time of year to hike in that we passed other groups of hikers only occasionally, despite the blue sky.  I expect in July it will be packed, especially with families because the smooth, level trails accommodate the youngest toddlers.  We saw quite a few green wing teals, some buffleheads and mallards as well as a couple of cormorants.  One of the cormorants was immature and thus tan from mid-chest up, which I haven't seen before. The art displays were nice.  The trails and railings were in great shape, good for a walking meditation.  The interpretive signs were very well done.  Note the donation station on your way; seems like a good cause.  A great place for a leisurely stroll on a sunny afternoon.\",\n",

Saw 2 eagles, 3 herons, and lots of crows and other little birdes in my trip. Nothing too exciting,it was just nice to be outside. Got a few miles in at each place and headed home. Nice park for locals. The trail runs parallel to the road through the Cedar and Madrona trees.

Since it was fairly short around 2 miles total, I figured Annie and I would hit another state park on the way home. She is only 4 weeks after surgery and I needed to take it easy on her. As soon as we drove into Belfair the fog rolled in and the views were less than desirable, but we made the best out of it. Trail was about half gravel and half wooden boardwalks. They had buckets with gravel and cans to sprinkle on board walk if you wanted.. some ice and snow in spots. There is a learning center in the middle that looked really cool for kids. We saw 3 blue heron birds, ducks, and some robins, and sparrows. Heard a few gun shots, must be a range in the area. One really loud Boom scared the hell out of me, I think I even ducked.. but besides that all good. It was really cold today in the 30’s but felt colder, we stopped for hot chocolate and then on to Kopachuck state park. We got a bit lost on the last turn to Ray Nash Road it’s not marked. But we finally found it, this is a really great little park on the sound and I believe I read it’s on the list of 13 parks to be shut down possibly due to budget cuts, what a shame. We just checked out the beach a little and made our way back over the bridge. We could see a tiny bit of the Olympic mountains, on a clear day it would have been magical.  In Belfair on the Hood Canal, The Mary Theyer Wetlands are a wonderful easy nature walk..3.5 miles total RT. A good trip for a rainy winter day. We saw eagles, mergansers, otters, coots, the boardwalk parts were very slippery- be careful. The entrance itself has a very cool Nature's Gate- felt like something out of The Hobbit- that is a great piece of art and there are also other interesting wood sculptures around. The environmental education center was closed but still fun to investigate- especially a huge fully articulated gray whale skeleton hanging over our head.

We started out about 9 and while the parking lot was absolutely packed there were very few people on the trail so we assume there was something going on at the school across the street. We went to the closest overlook first...spotting a few Yellow warblers along the way. From the overlook we saw lots of Tree Swallows zipping about. They frequently landed on the railings for a nice closeup look especially when using binoculars. We also saw Marsh Wren and Red-wing Blackbirds. In the distance we noticed a few Canada Geese. Heading back to take the longer trail and in the woodsy area we saw several birds, most unidentifiable except the robins and sparrows. I did catch sight of a Downy Woodpecker and was able get a decent photo. As we proceeded along the trail we saw more Red-Winged Blackbirds including the females, Marsh Wren, Killdeer, crows (whoopie 😏), House Finch, Tree and Barn Swallows, sparrows, more Canada Geese complete with goslings, and several pairs of Mallards. The trail is mostly open but in several places trees shade the path. It passes over several bridges and at the largest is where we saw the families of Canda Geese. Also, growing along the path were native roses in full bloom and on which we heard and saw lots of bees. We even saw a few butterflies. One really nice feature about the trail is that there are several small concrete benches on which to sit and take in the view. At the far end of the trail is an outhouse (hold your breath when you go in) and a couple of picnic tables. The tables are out in an open grassy area (no shade) surrounded by trees and shrubs. In the few hours we were there, we saw just a few people...young parents with babies in strollers, a couple small children, a couple of runners but mostly adults out for a stroll. For a list of birds that it is possible to see in the wetlands, check inside the Visitors center before you leave the parking lot to start your hike.

The trails wind through what looks like old forest filled with Madrona, Evergreens and more.  The trails lead off in every which direction and are currently not labeled, so watch out.  I made it down to the beach terminus which I believe is about 4 miles RT.  I went on a Friday and it was ever-so quiet in there, very few other people.  So if you're looking for a quick and quiet getaway in the Sequim/PA area, to hike/bike or ride your horse, this is the place.  Be sure to check out the link below for my blog on it. Enjoy!The directions for this trip are outdated.  Washington State Parks has built a fancy new trailhead with parking lot, restrooms, and horse unloading facility about one mile down the Diamond Point Road from Highway 101.  A Discover Pass is required.\\r There is also a new trail system.  The map is posted at the trailhead though not anywhere along the trails.  A copy of the trail map can be found here, a few pages in:\\r http://parks.state.wa.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/5572\\r The trail mileage on this map sums to about 14 miles, plus there are old roads that serve as trails.  A person I met said there are 26 total miles of walking available.  The shortest distance to the beach from the developed trailhead looks like around 4 miles.  You can make all sorts of loops too.\\r I did not make it to the beach, turning back about 3 miles in.  I wasn't quite sure where I was since there were no signs to mark the trails.  The forest consisted of big second growth conifers, with some madrones mixed in.  The next time I visit I will plan for a longer hike, possibly all day.  I hope there are a few more signs by then!\",\n",

Once a lookout is built to really see out to the bay it might be worth it, but for now the trail us brushy, half the loop is alongside the road and it boasts hardly any \"bay views.\" We explored just a small section of the interior trails, reaching the bluff or beach was longer one way than anticipated. This seemed like it would make an excellent park for a trail run (mixed terrain, not too muddy or steep for any length of time) but it still needs some work (including signage) to become a \"must do\" day hike destination.This is a bit of a day hike if you are coming over on a ferry from the Seattle-area, but it\\'s well worth the journey. The 3.3 mile walk to the beach is pretty uneventful, except for the wet, slippery boardwalk that consists of about 2.5 of those one-way miles. It helped that we brought our trekking poles. If you bring your trekking poles, don\\'t forget to attach the baskets to prevent the poles from going through the boardwalk gaps. Other equipement that was nice to have were gaitors, as there was quite a bit of knee-height wet grass along the trail. The reward for the long drive and somewhat uninspiring boardwalk are the views once you get to Cape Alava. I never realized that Washington had some coastline gems that are up there with Oregon\\'s. The view is spectacular even on a misty day. Both of the pictures were taken from campsites that are literally feet from the crashing waves.

In the areas where we haven't worked, well...it's obvious. It's a nice little forest walk (at this point I put on a rain skirt over my rain pants and that made for a little better hiking). \\r You still need rain boots of some sort for most of the puddles, but skunk cabbage is out, and the rivers and creeks are really full, making for a cool visual where they converge.Rain gear was needed for this 4 mile hike and rubber boots proved to be a good choice, as lots of water was flowing from the rainsoaked bluffs across the wide sandy beach. Check the tide tables, as you’ll want a low tide to explore the tide pools and see the sandstone arch at Browns Point.  Watched eagles flying above the windswept cliffs and crows pecking in the sand. This time of year on the Pacific Coast you are lucky if you see a sunset or the stars, but  the trade-off is you have the beaches practically to yourself once you hike beyond the trailhead.

Lots of gorgeous rocks to pick up and look at along the way, although its easy to fight the temptation to keep them (you definitely aren’t supposed to) when you realize that after they dry off a bit they aren’t nearly as shiny and lovely. But to admire? Yes please. We arrived at the tip of the spit at 1300. The lighthouse is beautifully maintained and manned by some of the most lovely volunteers.

       " 440: 'In search of a nice Fall hike, minus hunters, we opted for a Beach hike out at the Dungeness Spit. We have always wanted to see the lighthouse up close and in person. The day we selected to hike was blustery, chance of rain and high tide. So while it was not the most popular time or way to do this hike, it meant that in  less than a mile down the split we had the place to ourselves. Lots of Birds and seals in the distance. It was a bit of a hike about the rocks, kelp and logs due to high tide. Be sure to wear a good pull over hat, gloves and scarf as once you get out over open water on the spit the wind can be cutting. I was happy I had those items! As we passed the bend at about the 4 mile mark we came across a large dead seal that was a meal for some crows. This area is rugged and gorgeous even on a blustery day. Walking into the wind I think it took us just over two hours to reach the lighthouse. Once at the lighthouse we met some very kind ladies who were hosting tours to the top that day. We chatted and looked about for about 40 mins total. I was happy there was a clean restroom and water refill. The lighthouse is really well kept, they have historic pictures and a sign in sheet. I was excited that we could walk up the winding stairs to the top even. When we headed out now with the wind at our backs, we were just after high tide we could follow the shore tide line for a flatter walk and made good time back to the car. After 11 miles and about 5 hours time in the wind we were hungry. We stopped at the lovely Nourish Greenhouse dining in Sequim which made for a really unique and great day out of Seattle.This was a beautiful hike and the weather was perfect (sunny, high 50s) with the exception of an hour of rain. Pay attention to the tides add them make your trip nearly impossible. \\r The lighthouse tour is a must!',\n",
       " 441: \"Four of us went to Dungeness Spit to kill time before a friend's wedding at Purple Haze Lavender Farm. \\r We forgot our cash for the entrance fee, but before we went back to the car to grab wallets, a very nice man said he would pay our way. Thank you so much!\\r We didn't get all the way to the lighthouse, only to the snag about a mile down the beach, but it was a truly gorgeous day. The clouds were full of movement, and a propeller plane was playing in the sky, practicing rolls and backflips. Very cool. I do hope I can come back and make it to the lighthouse sometime.Mountain goupies take note, this is a great 10 mile beach walk with picnic tables in a beatiful lawn and a bathroom with running hot water at the lighthouse station ;) A nice change of pace if you wanat to do some sight seeing and take in a hike. See you back in the hills next hike!\",\n",
       " 442: \"Decided to find relief from the heat in Seattle, and the Olympic Peninsula seemed like a good choice since it was forecast to be in the 70's. It turned out to be a cool 58 degrees with a stiff breeze when I arrived at 8:00am. It was so cool, I wasn't sure if I was going to make it to the lighthouse at the other end of the spit, but eventually I did make it. In additional to the cool breeze there was a fog bank that never quite lifted, as well as smoke from the BC fires. The area is full of interesting sites, drift wood, seagulls, herons, and the sound of crashing waves is a constant. Did not see any harbor seals or deer\\xa0on this trip. The 5 miles out to the lighthouse is flat, but the sand and slope of the ground makes it actually fairly challenging, and I found myself as tired as is it were a hike with elevation. I spoke with the current Lighthouse keeper, and had a tour of the Lighthouse before I headed back to the car. The roundtrip took 5 hours, with lots of stops for photos, lunch at the lighthouse and taking with fellow hikers. All in all a great day, and would recommend it to anyone who hasn't been there before.nan\",\n",
       " 443: 'Our group of four took to the beach out to the Dungeness lighthouse on a -1.7 low tide. We began about two hours before the maximum low so we had lots of good beach surface to pick from. That helps when you have a ten and a half mile round trip. It was overcast on the way to the lighthouse so for until we rounded the bend at three and a half miles there was not much change in the scenery but at that point we could see the lighthouse. \\xa0After lunch on a picnic table we had a tour of the lighthouse by two of the weekly volunteers and a third volunteer met us when we got up at the top of the narrow stairs and filled us in on information about light and lens and some history. One item of interest is that the spit has been growing in length at fifteen feet a year over the last one hundred and twenty years. Originally the lighthouse was at the end of the existing length of the spit. Even from the top of the light it is hard to see the current northeast end of the land.\\nOn our return trip the clouds lifted and we had the grand view of the Olympics above the surf to the southwest. The beach surface was a bit firmer then in the morning... and as as the sign said, back to \"reality\"\\xa0This is the third time I\\'ve hiked this trail, and it remains an easy favorite. The trail itself is just a walk on the beach with many cool sights- lots of big ships, some marine life, and plenty of seagulls. The hike is about 5 miles one way, but it\\'s easy to truck right along- starting at the beach, it took us about 1 hr 15 min to get to the lighthouse. The lighthouse itself is a cool historical feature with great displays about how it came to be and the area around it. You can see Vancouver Island and the San Juans from the spit, which is super cool. The hike has no protection from the sun and the heat, so make sure you sunscreen up and bring a good hat- we all got pretty roasted out there.',\n",

We left the car at 11 am, with a quick stop at the bathrooms and then stopped at the fee station to pay the $3 fee. (You’ll need cash for this.)The tide was honestly still slightly higher than I would have liked, which wasn’t an issue for becoming wet, but it definitely made for a tougher trek on the legs. Climbing over driftwood and stepping through large rocks on softer, dry sand made for an exhausting five miles to get to the lighthouse. We saw a lot of birds along the way, and even got to witness a little guy struggling to take flight against the wind with his find of crab along the shores. It was pretty cool, to be honest. Lots of gorgeous rocks to pick up and look at along the way, although its easy to fight the temptation to keep them (you definitely aren’t supposed to) when you realize that after they dry off a bit they aren’t nearly as shiny and lovely. But to admire? Yes please. We arrived at the tip of the spit at 1300. The lighthouse is beautifully maintained and manned by some of the most lovely volunteers. They gave a tour and some fun historical information as one of them led us up to the top of the lighthouse on a super great tour! The lady told us to take our time observing things from above, offered to take our picture at the top, and was just amazingly sweet. They informed us of wind reality... as we could tell it was windy, but didn’t know exactly HOW windy... and the way back, we were going to be walking into the wind. 35 knots, which is 40 mph. And they were not kidding. It made for a bit of resistance and some absolutely incredible swells to watch as we made the trek back.Our trip back started at 1400, as we spent an hour enjoying the lighthouse and food!!! The lighthouse volunteers took some other people’s water bottles over to their house that they stay in and filled them, which I thought was pretty darn nice of them!We fought the wind on the way back and made it back to the car just before 1600. It was an absolutely perfect day, albeit windy. And it was definitely one of those once in a lifetime hikes for me... so wonderful. Lots of laughter and enjoyment as we completed this hike. I would definitely recommend it to others, as I found it to be completely mesmerizing and beautiful. I made the way there without a coat... and felt just fine, but was definitely happy to have my coat on while we went against the wind. My cheeks were pink and sore from the windburn, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world... what an experience.

We had checked the tide table earlier and knew we would be starting at high tide, but hoped it would subside as we trekked to the lighthouse.

       " 478: 'In search of a nice Fall hike, minus hunters, we opted for a Beach hike out at the Dungeness Spit. We have always wanted to see the lighthouse up close and in person. The day we selected to hike was blustery, chance of rain and high tide. So while it was not the most popular time or way to do this hike, it meant that in  less than a mile down the split we had the place to ourselves. Lots of Birds and seals in the distance. It was a bit of a hike about the rocks, kelp and logs due to high tide. Be sure to wear a good pull over hat, gloves and scarf as once you get out over open water on the spit the wind can be cutting. I was happy I had those items! As we passed the bend at about the 4 mile mark we came across a large dead seal that was a meal for some crows. This area is rugged and gorgeous even on a blustery day. Walking into the wind I think it took us just over two hours to reach the lighthouse. Once at the lighthouse we met some very kind ladies who were hosting tours to the top that day. We chatted and looked about for about 40 mins total. I was happy there was a clean restroom and water refill. The lighthouse is really well kept, they have historic pictures and a sign in sheet. I was excited that we could walk up the winding stairs to the top even. When we headed out now with the wind at our backs, we were just after high tide we could follow the shore tide line for a flatter walk and made good time back to the car. After 11 miles and about 5 hours time in the wind we were hungry. We stopped at the lovely Nourish Greenhouse dining in Sequim which made for a really unique and great day out of Seattle.Beautiful day to be on the peninsula.

A delightful couple tending the lighthouse this week provided us some historical background. Though there were many people on this beach/trail for the first mile, few went beyond that. We took the 7:15am ferry from Coupeville; arrived at the TH 9:30am; finished our picnic, tour and hiking at 2:30 pm; and had plenty of time to make our 5:15pm reservation out of Pt. Townsend. Warning: Due to road construction the sign for your turn-off from Hwy 101, Kitchen-Dick Road, may not be visible.\\r We recommend that you start the hike a couple hours prior to low tide (today it was 10:52am) if you are planning to go all the way out. This allows you to discover some of the intertidal wildlife and provides a better hiking surface on this sandy \"trail\". I was surprised that the strain on the feet and ankles was not too bad compared to other beach walking I\\'ve done.\\r For you bird enthusiasts--We saw pigeon guillemots with fish in their mouths, so we know they have burrows with babies nearby. The water was warm enough for human children and young adults to enjoy frolicking and getting wet. The sound of the waves, crashing and foaming, was absolutely mesmerizing, an acoustic dimension to hiking.\\r You\\'ll want to spend a least an hour on the grounds of the lighthouse and light keeper\\'s home. This is a great setting for a picnic (a few tables and benches), taking a nap on the lawn, and reading up on the history. Climbing to the top of the lighthouse is like making a summit, right?\\r The very tip of the spit is off limits and the inside shoreline is a nature preserve, but there is still a lot of shoreline to experience up close and personal with great views of Mt. Baker and the Olympics. There were absolutely no bugs! The next day I was on the south side of Mt.

One item of interest is that the spit has been growing in length at fifteen feet a year over the last one hundred and twenty years. Originally the lighthouse was at the end of the existing length of the spit. Even from the top of the light it is hard to see the current northeast end of the land.\\nOn our return trip the clouds lifted and we had the grand view of the Olympics above the surf to the southwest. The beach surface was a bit firmer then in the morning... and as as the sign said, back to \"reality\"\\xa0This is the third time I\\'ve hiked this trail, and it remains an easy favorite. The trail itself is just a walk on the beach with many cool sights- lots of big ships, some marine life, and plenty of seagulls. The hike is about 5 miles one way, but it\\'s easy to truck right along- starting at the beach, it took us about 1 hr 15 min to get to the lighthouse. The lighthouse itself is a cool historical feature with great displays about how it came to be and the area around it.

It was hard to believe the extent of the damage to the Spit.In at least 12 places the action from last weeks storm allowed waves to wash thru the shingle and beach log barrier.Our walk was just at high tide and at a couple of locations water from the Strait flowed into the Bay.Even without a \"\"super storm\"\" like we just experienced I could see the Spit becoming a chain of islands..',\n",
       " 526: 'nanA group of Island County Beach Watchers, intertidal geeks, \\'wracked\\' up 11 miles r.t. of hiking today along the shoreline of the Dungeness Spit. A delightful couple tending the lighthouse this week provided us some historical background. Though there were many people on this beach/trail for the first mile, few went beyond that. We took the 7:15am ferry from Coupeville; arrived at the TH 9:30am; finished our picnic, tour and hiking at 2:30 pm; and had plenty of time to make our 5:15pm reservation out of Pt. Townsend. Warning: Due to road construction the sign for your turn-off from Hwy 101, Kitchen-Dick Road, may not be visible.\\r We recommend that you start the hike a couple hours prior to low tide (today it was 10:52am) if you are planning to go all the way out. This allows you to discover some of the intertidal wildlife and provides a better hiking surface on this sandy \"trail\". I was surprised that the strain on the feet and ankles was not too bad compared to other beach walking I\\'ve done.\\r For you bird enthusiasts--We saw pigeon guillemots with fish in their mouths, so we know they have burrows with babies nearby. The water was warm enough for human children and young adults to enjoy frolicking and getting wet. The sound of the waves, crashing and foaming, was absolutely mesmerizing, an acoustic dimension to hiking.\\r You\\'ll want to spend a least an hour on the grounds of the lighthouse and light keeper\\'s home. This is a great setting for a picnic (a few tables and benches), taking a nap on the lawn, and reading up on the history. Climbing to the top of the lighthouse is like making a summit, right?\\r The very tip of the spit is off limits and the inside shoreline is a nature preserve, but there is still a lot of shoreline to experience up close and personal with great views of Mt. Baker and the Olympics. There were absolutely no bugs! The next day I was on the south side of Mt. Baker and it was 10 degrees warmer than the spit, so bring a light jacket or long-sleeved shirt even though it is mid summer.',\n",

       " 528: 'Mountain goupies take note, this is a great 10 mile beach walk with picnic tables in a beatiful lawn and a bathroom with running hot water at the lighthouse station ;) A nice change of pace if you wanat to do some sight seeing and take in a hike. See you back in the hills next hike!We were going to go backpacking but the weather in the North Cascades deteriorated for the weekend so we headed to the driest area in Washington State hoping to prolong summer a bit.  Our gamble paid off as the skies were blue for most of our \"hike\" along the coast.  The miles on the beach walk were totally worth it, especially for the view from the lighthouse at the end.  We walked barefoot on the way back and the extra work dodging rocks had us fairly sore back at the car but completely happy.  Most folks seem to stop within a mile of the trailhead so we were alone most of the hike.  The folks manning the lighthouse for the week were very cheerful and talked up to almost everyone about how anyone can rent out the lighthouse living quarters and help give tours themselves.  It sounds like a vacation worth considering!\\r Link to my gallery below.',\n",
       " 529: \"Trail is in great shape, and this is a nice place to explore even if you only see part of it. Our 18-mo had a blast running up and down the beach, playing in the sand and finding rocks to throw in the water, so we didn't make it past the first two miles. It was a fun outing since we were camping in the area. Beautiful coast, tons of good skipping stones, and great opportunities to see wildlife...we saw two bald eagles within our first fifteen minutes on the spit. Parking lot was packed full on Saturday at Noon.A storm had recently come through here and the beach was much narrower than normal. \\xa0In many spots we had to climb up on the drift logs to make our way toward the lighthouse. \\xa0The weather was great and except for a group of local elementary school kids we saw no one else on the trail. \\xa0Very fun to see the area after a storm!\",\n",

       " 531: 'Our group of four took to the beach out to the Dungeness lighthouse on a -1.7 low tide. We began about two hours before the maximum low so we had lots of good beach surface to pick from. That helps when you have a ten and a half mile round trip. It was overcast on the way to the lighthouse so for until we rounded the bend at three and a half miles there was not much change in the scenery but at that point we could see the lighthouse. \\xa0After lunch on a picnic table we had a tour of the lighthouse by two of the weekly volunteers and a third volunteer met us when we got up at the top of the narrow stairs and filled us in on information about light and lens and some history. One item of interest is that the spit has been growing in length at fifteen feet a year over the last one hundred and twenty years. Originally the lighthouse was at the end of the existing length of the spit. Even from the top of the light it is hard to see the current northeast end of the land.\\nOn our return trip the clouds lifted and we had the grand view of the Olympics above the surf to the southwest. The beach surface was a bit firmer then in the morning... and as as the sign said, back to \"reality\"\\xa0This is the third time I\\'ve hiked this trail, and it remains an easy favorite. The trail itself is just a walk on the beach with many cool sights- lots of big ships, some marine life, and plenty of seagulls. The hike is about 5 miles one way, but it\\'s easy to truck right along- starting at the beach, it took us about 1 hr 15 min to get to the lighthouse. The lighthouse itself is a cool historical feature with great displays about how it came to be and the area around it. You can see Vancouver Island and the San Juans from the spit, which is super cool. The hike has no protection from the sun and the heat, so make sure you sunscreen up and bring a good hat- we all got pretty roasted out there.',\n",

It\\'s a great rainy day hike and is right off the paved road so a great choice for new hikers or anyone with non-all wheel drive vehicle!The Bridge at the Big Creek Camp Ground is still out, so park there and walk west on 119. Just after the road goes over Big Creek you will see orange markers leading the way to the trail. It\\'s actually a nice little makeshift trailhead that leads under some great moss ridden downed trees. We stayed to the left at the fork. Tons of moss overgrowth accompanying much debris. The trail is a pretty steady incline, we hiked 1.7 miles to the Confluence loop trail. Snow in places up to a 1.5 miles, after that it\\'s all snow. Watch your step on the loop trail, the snow is deep and icy hiding many a rouge hole and parts of the river. We spent a good amount of time crossing back and forth across the creeks exploring plenty of pools and falls. Massive boulders line the banks and beds and create all sorts of good action. Still pretty cold and we encountered some \"snowy hail\". We also enjoyed the small foot bridges, but they were still icy, so use caution. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had to return to Kitsap to pick up our daughter from school so we tunred around there. We\\'ll surely return to hike the rest of the Big Creek Loop.',\n",

The first mile was really easy, but then it started to climb steadily with some steep inclines at parts.  The trail was very well maintained.  All the bridges were in good repair. We encountered a few folks, but not many. It took us about 3.5 hours to do the complete hike including the extra half mile at the bottom back to our car with about a half hour stop for a picnic lunch.  The fall foliage was out as well as the sun, which was quite a surprise since it was pouring rain on our drive in from Olympia.  Lots of waterfalls & rushing rivers, truly beautiful scenery.  Will have to take the kids back this summer.  This would be a great summer hike because of all the shade from the trees.This my first hike I have done since a child. It got me hooked. The trails were very nice and easy to fallow. The campground was under construction but didn't seem to be a problem at all. Once up into the mountain it was beautiful. Moss covered ground with tall thin trees and the light peaking through. The babbling creeks with little pools were stunning. We took our Collie Star with us and she was in heaven, a little scared on all the charming bridges but in heaven none the less. My husband and I kept arguing over who would take the lead because we kept walking through new spiderwebs but nothing to bad.\",\n",

No bugs problems for me.A few updates on the Big Creek trail (otherwise same as other recent reports):One log across trail, easily negotiated, at about 1.5 miles going counter-clockwise. I’m making up that mileage (so Dave can tease me later when Mt. Rose crew fixes this). Needs a pry bar or burly worker (not me!).Reports of “angry bees” between the two bridges before Skinwood Creek from hikers going clockwise who had stings to themselves and dogs made us opt for the confluence detour. We did not see any bees, so using the confluence trail may be the way to avoid them, and a heads up as to what section of trail they’re on.The Ellinor trail is closed due to aggressive goats (maybe we could sic the bees on the goats?), but you can still hike up the extra mile (and about doubles the gain so a better workout) to the viewpoint.

       " 570: 'Took advantage of the beautiful weather to check out Big Creek on Sunday, August 27. There were plenty of parking spaces in the campground parking lot when we got there at 11am. The pit toilets were super clean and we met the super friendly camp hosts when we got there.\\nThe trailhead was easy to find and very clearly marked. We took the advice of others here and went to the left first. It was a brisk uphill climb for 1.7 miles. There are many benches along the way, and we took advantage of a couple; \\xa0otherwise, our 5 and 9 year olds (and we) made the trek up just fine. The convergence at the top was more than worth the climb. We ducked down the convergence trail and spent a good hour playing in the cold water, resting on the rocks, and snacking. It was gorgeous.\\xa0\\nContinuing the loop after our break was fun--a lot of bridges to cross, and the downhill was slow and steady, and was easy for all 4 of us. We got back to the car and the lot, and most of the campground was empty. We passed one person on the way up, we shared the convergence for about 15\\xa0mins with another couple before they continued on. Other than that, we had the whole trail to ourselves.\\xa0\\nThis was a lovely day hike, well worth the trip from Seattle. the trail was very well maintained and easy to follow. We will definitely be back.\\nSide note--we followed another reviewer here and took a right on 119 and stopped at the free rec. areas to swim on the north end of\\xa0Lake Cushman as a refreshing reward after a wonderful hike.\\xa0This is such a great little hike! There is always something different to see..Beit a new troll on skinwood creek bridge or a stump filled with layers of rocks. I just love this hike! We went up via the left side of trail and looped around. The sounds of the creek in the background is so soothing as you hike up to the 900 elevation level.

Watch your step on the loop trail, the snow is deep and icy hiding many a rouge hole and parts of the river. We spent a good amount of time crossing back and forth across the creeks exploring plenty of pools and falls. Massive boulders line the banks and beds and create all sorts of good action.

It\\'s a great rainy day hike and is right off the paved road so a great choice for new hikers or anyone with non-all wheel drive vehicle!The Bridge at the Big Creek Camp Ground is still out, so park there and walk west on 119. Just after the road goes over Big Creek you will see orange markers leading the way to the trail. It\\'s actually a nice little makeshift trailhead that leads under some great moss ridden downed trees. We stayed to the left at the fork. Tons of moss overgrowth accompanying much debris. The trail is a pretty steady incline, we hiked 1.7 miles to the Confluence loop trail. Snow in places up to a 1.5 miles, after that it\\'s all snow. Watch your step on the loop trail, the snow is deep and icy hiding many a rouge hole and parts of the river. We spent a good amount of time crossing back and forth across the creeks exploring plenty of pools and falls. Massive boulders line the banks and beds and create all sorts of good action. Still pretty cold and we encountered some \"snowy hail\". We also enjoyed the small foot bridges, but they were still icy, so use caution. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had to return to Kitsap to pick up our daughter from school so we tunred around there.

       " 604: 'On a sunny winter day in Seattle, my visiting friend and I decided we wanted to get an up-close view of the mountains that looked so beautiful from the city. We got an afternoon start and drove out without much of a plan; the friendly people at the Hoodsport visitor information center recommended Big Creek. Don\\'t be scared away by the sign saying it\\'s closed at the start of highway 119 - the campground is closed, but the trail is open! Our hopes of dramatic mountain scenery didn\\'t pan out as the peninsula was pretty cloudy, but we got (lightly) snowed on, which was fun. We headed up towards Mount Ellinor partway through, where a sign said there was a lookout 1 mile up, and were not surprised to find it too foggy to see anything. But that was still a great trail to climb, and we wished we\\'d planned ahead to go farther up towards the peak, but had to turn around at the lookout and finish off the loop. With the add-on to the lookout point, my GPS watch had the whole route at 6.8 miles.\\nThe trail was in great condition and has a lot of cool wooden bridges to cross. Even without any dramatic views, the immediate scenery of the trail was still great, and it was cool to see rainforest-y plants coated in snow. Will definitely come back to this area again for some longer routes.The Bridge at the Big Creek Camp Ground is still out, so park there and walk west on 119.

The trail was in great shape (thank you WTA!) With only a few rocks and roots here and there. Definitely worth taking your time!A few updates on the Big Creek trail (otherwise same as other recent reports):One log across trail, easily negotiated, at about 1.5 miles going counter-clockwise. I’m making up that mileage (so Dave can tease me later when Mt. Rose crew fixes this). Needs a pry bar or burly worker (not me!).Reports of “angry bees” between the two bridges before Skinwood Creek from hikers going clockwise who had stings to themselves and dogs made us opt for the confluence detour. We did not see any bees, so using the confluence trail may be the way to avoid them, and a heads up as to what section of trail they’re on.The Ellinor trail is closed due to aggressive goats (maybe we could sic the bees on the goats?), but you can still hike up the extra mile (and about doubles the gain so a better workout) to the viewpoint. However, the trees have grown quite a bit and obscure a lot of the view that used to be had, at least from the viewpoint at 1 mile from the junction with Ellinor connector.

The first mile was really easy, but then it started to climb steadily with some steep inclines at parts.  The trail was very well maintained.  All the bridges were in good repair. We encountered a few folks, but not many. It took us about 3.5 hours to do the complete hike including the extra half mile at the bottom back to our car with about a half hour stop for a picnic lunch.  The fall foliage was out as well as the sun, which was quite a surprise since it was pouring rain on our drive in from Olympia.  Lots of waterfalls & rushing rivers, truly beautiful scenery.  Will have to take the kids back this summer.  This would be a great summer hike because of all the shade from the trees.Took advantage of probably the last 60deg sunny day for the year. Nice trail with an assortment of bridges over creeks. Trail is not too steep but does go uphill for 2 miles before crossing creek(s) and going back down the other side. There were a number of nice benches in good spots to rest. Big Creek campground closed Sep 25 so have to park in front of the gate.

For those confused, walk around the gates and down the road by campsites, when you reach the second outhouse building, you can start the loop from there. Carrying kids, it took us a bit less than 3 hours to complete the loop, with a side excursion to the confluence bridges and quick stop to put spikes on and have a snack.

Watch your step on the loop trail, the snow is deep and icy hiding many a rouge hole and parts of the river.

I’m making up that mileage (so Dave can tease me later when Mt. Rose crew fixes this). Needs a pry bar or burly worker (not me!).Reports of “angry bees” between the two bridges before Skinwood Creek from hikers going clockwise who had stings to themselves and dogs made us opt for the confluence detour. We did not see any bees, so using the confluence trail may be the way to avoid them, and a heads up as to what section of trail they’re on.The Ellinor trail is closed due to aggressive goats (maybe we could sic the bees on the goats?), but you can still hike up the extra mile (and about doubles the gain so a better workout) to the viewpoint. However, the trees have grown quite a bit and obscure a lot of the view that used to be had, at least from the viewpoint at 1 mile from the junction with Ellinor connector.

The rhodies are at their end, but there are still some nice ones to be found. and for a sunny Sunday afternoon, the trail seemed relatively uncrowded.\\nThe hikers-with-dogs to hikers-alone ratio seemed higher than typical. We saw six other people (three couples) and everyone had dogs. I think we only saw one group without a dog, and they were in the parking lot, getting ready to go as we got back to the car. All dogs were leashed, too! Which made the dog meetings on trail much less stressful for everyone. Thank you, fellow hikers! A very nice (and long overdue) outing with a good friend. Can't wait for the next one!Took a great hike today with my wife and dog. When we got to the parking lot there were about ten other cars. That being said, we only saw a few people during the whole loop. Stopped at the confluence for a nice lunch and to check out the roaring stream.\",\n",

Too foggy for the views today but there was still a lot of visual rewards and spots to enjoy along the way.  Fall foliage is just beginning, Ill go back in a few weeks to really enjoy the colors.  No bugs problems for me.A few updates on the Big Creek trail (otherwise same as other recent reports):One log across trail, easily negotiated, at about 1.5 miles going counter-clockwise. I’m making up that mileage (so Dave can tease me later when Mt. Rose crew fixes this). Needs a pry bar or burly worker (not me!).Reports of “angry bees” between the two bridges before Skinwood Creek from hikers going clockwise who had stings to themselves and dogs made us opt for the confluence detour. We did not see any bees, so using the confluence trail may be the way to avoid them, and a heads up as to what section of trail they’re on.The Ellinor trail is closed due to aggressive goats (maybe we could sic the bees on the goats?), but you can still hike up the extra mile (and about doubles the gain so a better workout) to the viewpoint. However, the trees have grown quite a bit and obscure a lot of the view that used to be had, at least from the viewpoint at 1 mile from the junction with Ellinor connector.

A quick call to the Quilcene ranger station to inquire about the snow level and trail access turned us onto Mt. Walker.  Me: \"Snow level?\" Ranger (nonchalantly): \"The highway.\"We caught the Edmonds-Kingston ferry over to the Olympic penninsula and headed over to the viewpoint trail up Mt. Walker for a little (more) snowshoeing.Highway 101 was in terrific shape (bare and dry), despite all of the recent snow and cold temps.  It was exactly 32 degrees when we hit the parking at the gate (the road up Mt. Walker is gated in the winter).  Even on a Friday afternoon in the dead of winter, this trail seems quite popular.  We got a late start (well after 1:00 p.m.), and there were 10 cars at the trailhead, which meant we had to park along Highway 101 (yikes).Thanks to the recent snow, we strapped on the snowshoes right at the car and headed straight up the road.  Between the gate and the trailhead, the snow was frozen and crusty, so we really didn\\'t even need the snowshoes.  The trail itself was hard-packed and icy, and even bare dirt in a few places.  If you\\'re going to snowshoe this, it\\'s probably better just heading up the road.  If you\\'re going to ski it, the road is probably the only real option.We only went for about a mile (which, with the kids, took us well over an hour) before my two year old in the backpack reported into my right ear (loudly, frequently, repeatedly, and adamantly) that her \\'FOOT WET!\\' (I\\'m pretty sure she meant cold, but whatever - she was done...), so we turned around and headed back down to the car (disturbing the natural serenity to an embarassing degree along the way).The snow was very beautiful right from the start, and my kids spotted a fair number of wildlife tracks, but no wildlife (we tend to make a bit of noise).Walked up the road and walked down the trail.

Trail starts on the right side of Forest Road 2730 but parking is on the left side, just one quarter mile from Highway 101. The 1st quarter mile of the trail is relatively easy but after that it gets down to kicking your butt. As the write up says, the trail is 2 miles up hill with a gain of 2,000 feet up to an elevation of 2,800 feet. The trail is in good shape with 5 trees fallen across the trail which were easy to step over. The trail is mostly dirt with some tree roots and minimal rocks. This trail is mostly at a 10 to 20% grade so your calves and hamstrings get a workout. You have to lean and push forward most of the way up this trail. When you think your coming to a level spot to take a break think again. There is very little level spots until you get to the top.  \\r  Once you reach the top you are at the north view point of Olympic National Forest looking at Mount Constantine, Mount Townsend and Mount Baker in the far distance. The snow level looked to be at 5,500 feet or so on Mount Townsend. To get to south view point you have to continue on trail to parking lot then walk the forest road on top which is well worth the hike of about 1/4 mile. From the south side you can see Seattle, Puget Sound and Mount Rainier on a clear day. It was sunny today but visibility limited my ability to get a clear shot of Mount Baker and Mount Rainier. I could see them but it was hazy. \\rThere is a road that you can drive to the top for none hikers which is about 4 1/2 miles long. The South View Point has handicap access which is nice. It is a dirt trail but pretty smooth and level. It took me 3.8 hours round trip with lunch at the top and walking to both view points for pictures and videos. It was every bit worth hiking to the top.

A quick call to the Quilcene ranger station to inquire about the snow level and trail access turned us onto Mt. Walker.  Me: \"Snow level?\" Ranger (nonchalantly): \"The highway.\"We caught the Edmonds-Kingston ferry over to the Olympic penninsula and headed over to the viewpoint trail up Mt. Walker for a little (more) snowshoeing.Highway 101 was in terrific shape (bare and dry), despite all of the recent snow and cold temps.  It was exactly 32 degrees when we hit the parking at the gate (the road up Mt. Walker is gated in the winter).  Even on a Friday afternoon in the dead of winter, this trail seems quite popular.  We got a late start (well after 1:00 p.m.), and there were 10 cars at the trailhead, which meant we had to park along Highway 101 (yikes).Thanks to the recent snow, we strapped on the snowshoes right at the car and headed straight up the road.  Between the gate and the trailhead, the snow was frozen and crusty, so we really didn\\'t even need the snowshoes.  The trail itself was hard-packed and icy, and even bare dirt in a few places.  If you\\'re going to snowshoe this, it\\'s probably better just heading up the road.  If you\\'re going to ski it, the road is probably the only real option.We only went for about a mile (which, with the kids, took us well over an hour) before my two year old in the backpack reported into my right ear (loudly, frequently, repeatedly, and adamantly) that her \\'FOOT WET!\\' (I\\'m pretty sure she meant cold, but whatever - she was done...), so we turned around and headed back down to the car (disturbing the natural serenity to an embarassing degree along the way).The snow was very beautiful right from the start, and my kids spotted a fair number of wildlife tracks, but no wildlife (we tend to make a bit of noise).Hiked Mt.

       " 847: 'Found this trail on an internet website and looked it up on wta.org and decided to hike it since I knew there wasn\\'t any snow on top. Trail starts on the right side of Forest Road 2730 but parking is on the left side, just one quarter mile from Highway 101. The 1st quarter mile of the trail is relatively easy but after that it gets down to kicking your butt. As the write up says, the trail is 2 miles up hill with a gain of 2,000 feet up to an elevation of 2,800 feet. The trail is in good shape with 5 trees fallen across the trail which were easy to step over. The trail is mostly dirt with some tree roots and minimal rocks. This trail is mostly at a 10 to 20% grade so your calves and hamstrings get a workout. You have to lean and push forward most of the way up this trail. When you think your coming to a level spot to take a break think again. There is very little level spots until you get to the top.  \\r  Once you reach the top you are at the north view point of Olympic National Forest looking at Mount Constantine, Mount Townsend and Mount Baker in the far distance. The snow level looked to be at 5,500 feet or so on Mount Townsend. To get to south view point you have to continue on trail to parking lot then walk the forest road on top which is well worth the hike of about 1/4 mile. From the south side you can see Seattle, Puget Sound and Mount Rainier on a clear day. It was sunny today but visibility limited my ability to get a clear shot of Mount Baker and Mount Rainier. I could see them but it was hazy. \\rThere is a road that you can drive to the top for none hikers which is about 4 1/2 miles long. The South View Point has handicap access which is nice.

Trail starts on the right side of Forest Road 2730 but parking is on the left side, just one quarter mile from Highway 101. The 1st quarter mile of the trail is relatively easy but after that it gets down to kicking your butt. As the write up says, the trail is 2 miles up hill with a gain of 2,000 feet up to an elevation of 2,800 feet. The trail is in good shape with 5 trees fallen across the trail which were easy to step over. The trail is mostly dirt with some tree roots and minimal rocks. This trail is mostly at a 10 to 20% grade so your calves and hamstrings get a workout. You have to lean and push forward most of the way up this trail. When you think your coming to a level spot to take a break think again. There is very little level spots until you get to the top.  \\r  Once you reach the top you are at the north view point of Olympic National Forest looking at Mount Constantine, Mount Townsend and Mount Baker in the far distance. The snow level looked to be at 5,500 feet or so on Mount Townsend. To get to south view point you have to continue on trail to parking lot then walk the forest road on top which is well worth the hike of about 1/4 mile. From the south side you can see Seattle, Puget Sound and Mount Rainier on a clear day. It was sunny today but visibility limited my ability to get a clear shot of Mount Baker and Mount Rainier. I could see them but it was hazy. \\rThere is a road that you can drive to the top for none hikers which is about 4 1/2 miles long. The South View Point has handicap access which is nice. It is a dirt trail but pretty smooth and level. It took me 3.8 hours round trip with lunch at the top and walking to both view points for pictures and videos.

Then, I just suddenly decided to hike the road ALL the way back down to the trailhead. Honestly, it was a risky decision at 6 P.M. not even knowing how long the road was lol. oops could've ended up hiking down the road in the dark... We made really good time though and everything worked out:) The road must be about 4.5 - 5 miles long because My GPS said 7 miles roundtrip total. There was a spot on the road where some pretty serious rocks have fallen over the road. Looks like you could easily drive around it (if you are driving). Just thought it might be worth mentioning. Lots and lots of wildflowers including hundreds of beautiful blooming rhododendrons! Nice view from both viewpoints even though it was a cloudy day. I could see Seattle from up there although I couldn't seem to get it to turn out in a picture.\",\n",

Steady climb to the top as this hike gains 2000' in 2 miles. \\r Hiked 4.6 miles in 1 hour 45 mins. \\r Happy Trails!Great views of the Kitsap Peninsula with a fantastic forest on the way up.

       " 957: \"We got our camping permit and bear cans in Port Angeles then drove up to Neah Bay to get our Meka recreation pass. Once you get to Shi Shi trail head make sure you park in a lo designated for over night parking. We parked about a half mile from the trail head. We backpacked in. The trail was wet and very muddy. There were huge mud pits and at times were avoidable when there was a side path. Sometimes we just had to go right through it. Once you get to the end there is a huge down hill you have to conquer thats full of slippery slopes and tree roots. Be very careful. There are ropes provided to assist you. Once we made it down we went right on to the beach and set up camp. There is a toilet that was made off the side of the trail for easy use. Its semi-open. Towards the evening it started to rain. We couldn't make a fire but saw other ppl making fires in the woods so we joined another group for a little. It rained through the night. The ocean and rain sounds were very calming. Surprisingly it was not very cold like I had expected it to be but never under estimate the weather. In the morning the sky was blue and the sun was shining. It was low tide and we were able to go explore the tide pools. We saw crabs, hermit crabs, anenomies, and starfish. The hike back was also a muddy mess.It was Friday night when I decided that I didn't want to spend the whole weekend in the city, so I prepped my pack that night and set out promptly on my own schedule first thing Saturday morning.  The drive from Seattle is probably one of the longest to get to any hike in WA and then tack on stopping at the Olympic NP visitor center in Port Angeles - it was a long drive. \\r When I arrived at the Makah Reservation I was told that there was parking at the trailhead, but that the parking was private (and thus paid). When I got close to the trailhead, I arrived at a persons house where there were tons of cars on the front lawn - it was almost entirely full. About 0.5 mi down the road (away from Shi Shi TH) there was another local offering parking, and his lot was near empty. Funny thing is that when I got to the first lot, I parked, got out, and talked to some people who had also just arrived to see what the deal was. Well, the total cost to park at this lot was $10 for use and $10 per night! Seeing as how no one seemed to be home at that house and how I only had $10 in my wallet (stupid me) I drove to the further lot to find out that the parking there was only $10, wooo! It was a no brainer, more spots, cheaper AND the guy who lived there would give you a lift to the TH if he was around. As I was getting my stuff ready to go, he (Dana) and his wife arrived home and he offered me a lift. It was pretty great AND this whole thing only cost me $10!\\r The Shi Shi Beach trail was pretty mellow and I was able to bust it out pretty easily. The vegetation in the  area is pretty neat too because its so wet (think temperate rain forests) but also so close to the water, so you have somewhat short trees mixed in with some mammoth trees. The elevation gain in this is near nothing and happens all at once as you descend down to the beach via ropes. If you are skittish of steep slopes then you may have a little difficulty. There are also lot of roots here so it helps to have some good traction hiking boots. I was surprised at the number of day hikers I saw in sneakers or something similar. Not to mention all the mud on the trail - it didn't phase me one bit - I pretty much marched through every mud area without stopping thanks to Gore-Tex boots!\\r Now, the beach is pretty amazing, as you exit the forest and come out onto the beach your field of view becomes gigantic and you finally get a glimpse of the expansive Pacific Northwest coast. I was somewhat unlucky with weather this trip - I was stuck in a marine layer pretty much all weekend, not that that is uncommon there... I had actually planned on going to Shi Shi to stargaze, hoping that any moisture would have dispersed by night time. Note: the light pollution out there is pretty much non-existent... \\r I walked about a mile and a half down the beach to Petroleum Creek and set up camp near a driftwood fort. Even though park rules try to maintain that people don't make these, there were a LOT of them all over the beach... After everything was set I took off down the beach with my friends ridiculously nice camera to try and test my photog skills. I can safely say that I don't know how to use a nice camera like that hah... Regardless, the Point of Arches and surrounding tide pools came into view as I got closer and my, what a site! When I arrived back at the site I pulled out a book and my backcountry chair and made myself comfortable before starting to cook dinner. \\r The next day was a bit more clear come 9AM, but still foggy. At least you could see the extent of the immediate coastline. I set off pretty hastily and made my way back to my car so that I could get a good start on the drive. Overall, the trip was excellent - I wanted some personal solitude and that is what I got despite camping with at least 20 other groups and having 4G LTE coverage... It was really nice to get away.\",\n",
       " 958: \"Having backpacked the northernmost stretch of the Olympic Coast from Shi Shi Beach to Sand Point a couple years ago, we moved on to the next segment, from Sand Point to Rialto Beach. Actually, we hiked it the reverse direction (from Rialto Beach to Sand Point) because the timing of the low tides worked out better that way.\\nThe reef rocks north of Norwegian Memorial are reputedly one of the roughest sections of Olympic coastline. This is probably because the rocky section goes on for a relatively long distance (2-4 miles). It’s slow going, but the terrain itself didn’t seem as tough as a couple of areas further south, closer to Chilean Memorial.\\nThe ropes on the overland trails were intact, although we only ended up using the two overland trails between Cape Johnson and Cedar Creek. On the northernmost one of these two trails (the first overland trail south of Cedar Creek), the north side of the headland was rather challenging to climb down. It’s an especially long, especially steep trail with only one rope the entire way (about 100’). It was doable, but if I’d known how difficult it would be, I would’ve made a point of getting around the headland before the tide came in, rather than lingering on the beach taking pictures of sea stacks and bald eagles. J I imagine it wouldn’t be as difficult to climb UP this side of the headland, if traveling from north to south.\\nThere are plenty of freshwater streams along the way to collect water, although some are larger and/or more accessible than others. We successfully collected water from Cedar Creek, Norwegian Creek, and Yellow Banks. The only stretch of coast with NO reliable water sources is between Norwegian Memorial and Yellow Banks, so we were sure to fill up at Norwegian Creek before heading north.\\nSpeaking of water, we brought water shoes in case any of the streams were deep enough to require fording. However, we didn’t end up using them -- all the streams were low enough to be easily crossed in hiking boots.\\nI was glad I wore gaiters along with my shorts. They did a great job of keeping the sand out of my boots.\\nApart from a few biting flies on the shore, bugs weren’t an issue except near the woods. A lot of the campsites are just off the beach, on the border between the piled-up logs on the upper beach and the woods. The minute you get into the woods (even right on the edge), you’ll start seeing mosquitoes.\\nIf you camp on the beach itself, be sure to pitch your tent above the HIGHEST high tide line predicted for that night. Every day one high tide is higher than the other, and during our trip the higher tide was at night. (Is it always that way?)\\nThe Green Trails map indicates that there’s a ranger station on the beach south of Cedar Creek, but we never spotted it. However, we did encounter an actual ranger on this beach, checking permits. Between Chilean Memorial and Norwegian Memorial the coastline is relatively remote, where the hikers are most likely true backpackers through-hiking all the way from Rialto Beach to Ozette (or vice-versa). Although it was nice to see a ranger here, it would be even more important to have a ranger presence closer to each trailhead, where there are far more people (and where there will be more “casual” campers without permits).\\nNote: Fires are prohibited at Yellow Banks. We stayed at a campsite that included a fire ring, but since fires aren’t allowed here, we dismantled it in hopes of discouraging others from using it.This hike has been on my to do list for years so this hot 3 day weekend seemed like a perfect time to finally make it happen.  My wife and I took our two teenage boys with us forcing them to unplug for at least a couple of days.  Good for us to unplug as well.  A thank you goes out to previous posts that explained what was needed in regards to permits and parking.  \\rWe got off to a very late start on Friday and didn't make it all the way to Neah Bay, stopping in Clallum Bay and sleeping in our truck in a pull off next to the beach.  We took the scenic route next to water instead of taking 101 past Lake Crescent before turning up towards Clallum Bay which was slow going on a winding road.  Got to the trail head in the morning and headed off on the trail.  It's in good shape, very little mud along the way.  The last section down to the beach is pretty steep and a little challenging with a heavy backpack but very doable.  When we picked up our permit from the PA Ranger station, we were told that they had issues over 200 permits for the weekend and when got down to the beach it was evident that those permits were all in use.  Luckily we found a great spot that had been vacated that morning and we set up our tents.  Given the number of tents along the beach it still didn't seem crowded with people.  We made the long trek to the rocks at the south end of the beach as the tide was going out to explore the tide pools and caves and stayed through the sunset before heading back to camp for the evening.  Next morning I got up and enjoyed the sunrise and watched multiple groups loading up and hiking out.  Reluctantly we eventually did the same.\\r In regards to campfires, I don't recall seeing anything posted at the trail head but the ranger issuing permits let us know there was a burn ban and varies state wide burn bans were announced on the local news heading into the weekend.  Despite the burn ban a couple of groups  had fires going as we came back from the south end of the beach.  In the morning one of them was still burning and no one was up at their camp site.  Coming back into Neah Bay the sky had a yellow/orange tint to it from the fires up in Canada.\",\n",
       " 959: \"Consult the tide tables prior to doing this hike. We went during high tide (unknowingly) and therefore didn't get to see the amazing tide pools. Otherwise this hike was super fun, really beautiful and unique. I've done the trail in March and found the muddy path much easy to maneuver in June. There are alot of side trails you can take to avoid some of the muddier spots.I stayed a few nights on Shi Shi Beach. The parking situation is a bit unique. They don't offer trailhead parking for overnight stays. In fact the park itself supports paying the local residents cash for parking your vehicle in their yards. It was $10 a day. It adds 0.6 miles to your hike if you plan on parking in their yard. It was a pretty easy hike to the beach. The trail was muddy but not overgrown with plenty of trail markers to show the way. The only tricky part of the hike is the descent down to the beach from the top of the bluff. If you use the guide ropes it can offer some assurance to those who have a slight fear of heights. \\r Once on the beach there are a few camping spots right as you arrive. Other than that you can pretty much camp anywhere along the beach. Try and stay out of the range of high tide. Only a handful of camp spots are among the treeline, giving you protection from the wind and rain. \\r The points are amazing to explore during low tide. With lots of cool sea life to see. I woke up the second morning with baby deer walking right up to my camp site. There were also many Bald Eagles that came right up to me. Was a bit surreal. \\r I found it a bit difficult to collect fresh water. This was my first trip here and had looked at several maps that had shown streams and creeks that flowed into the ocean from this location. The flows of water that I did find were a bit stagnant. I managed to find a little flow of fresh water that I was able to filter and boil for drinking and cooking. \\r There was a ton of debris washed up on the shore. I assume it is left over from the tsunami that hit Japan as lots of the trash had Japanese markings. \\r I got rained on during my stay and it wasn't warm enough to try and venture into the surf. But it was beautiful to look at.\",\n",
       " 960: \"Wonderful day to play around Priest Point Park in Olympia! The kids enjoyed the playground (which was well maintained). We parked and made sure our valuables where stowed away properly per WTA pro advise on vehicle prowling. We made our way down to the beach and the tide was out, which allowed the kids to play around the mud fields. We found an awesome tree cave the kids had a blast climbing in. The trails were in pretty good shape, but i see there being an issue if there was a steady rain. The trails could get a little slick and messy. We had a few issues wanting to follow trails that weren't designated for travel but looked like they were passable. It was 42 degrees with a strong breeze towards the water as you would expect. So make sure you dress warm and enjoy !Good trail system here. They provide a lot of signage to let you know where you are. They also have information boards along the trail that overlooks the Budd Inlet. Ellis Cove is a great trail to hike to catch the sunset!\",\n",
       " 961: 'Shi Shi is still there and beautiful as ever, and a great day hike for all abilities -but the trail you could have floated a kayak down.  It rained HARD the night before in the nearby local tribal campsites (don\\'t forget your $10 Makah permit obtained anywhere in Neah Bay) and was still raining when I set down the trail at around 1045.  The trail has large puddles and muddy spots so wear waterproof boots, or hike in shoes that don\\'t irritate your feet if they get wet.  Trekking poles are great to vault yourself over these spots.  I did that a lot, and also zig zagged a lot like a drunken dancing bear trying to preserve the waterproofing on my boots.  The wood rails on the trail at spots served to hold water rather than define the trail edge.  ATV use in areas  left deep mud ruts. Someone broke the \"private property\" direction sign, btw, in the straightaway area.  A large alder tree fell across the trail and you must go under it about halfway.   At the very end of the trail, as you enter the Olympic NP you are filled in with some details that might discourage the casual/spontaneous overnight camper...  high wind snapping a few limbs, no pets on beach, two permits required (backcountry and the aforementioned tribal permit required) a bear canisters requirement, no dry firewood available to discourage night predators, and scary looking descent/ascent ropes that you should not trust with your entire bodily weight.  Just use them to stabilize yourself.  None of these things should be news I guess.  All in all it took an hour to get to the beach without utilizing shortcuts and with semi-dainty detours around deep mud holes.   At the beach you can abandon your shoes for a while, and the wind really cools you down in a hurry.After short and pleasant hike to Cape Flattery, we headed to Shi Shi Beach trailhead. Started hiking at 1.30 pm being watered by rain. Trail is really muddy, be prepared to cross large puddles and mud pools. I would highly recommend appropriate footwear. Be also prepared to a steep descent to the beach, although we found it really funny. Ropes are provided for your safety (one of them was quite prickly, so gloves would be a nice idea). \\r Beach views are truly rewarding. Unfortunately we couldn\\'t cross Petroleum creek as it was too broad and deep for our shoes, so we didn\\'t make it to Point of Arches. Still we got a nice idea about how great this structure is.\\r Got better weather on the way back. Also spotted some wildlife, including fox, rabbit and squirrels. Way to the trailhead took us about 1 h 15 min, and total hiking time was 3 h 15 min. Encountered just a couple of parties on our way.\\r To sum up, prepare yourself before hiking Shi Shi Beach trail - and you\\'ll get really great and funny experience.',\n",

       " 968: 'Jan 3, 2009: Cape Alava – Sand Point loopRain and snow, determinedly leaching out every bit of color from the surroundings...cold, gusting breezes, sapping every bit of warmth from my body…a sun that had thrown up its hands in disgust and just given up…Northwest hiking at its finest!This trip was supposed to have been done 2 weeks ago. However, the recent heavy snowfall, followed by the slow thaw kept it being postponed; finally, I could wait no longer and decided to give it my best shot, no matter what the conditions. After a fitful night, I caught the 5:45am Edmonds-Kingston ferry and made my way over to the Olympic Peninsula. Gloomy driving had me at Lake Crescent, where I was determined to stop and take a few photographs, since I hadn’t done so on another recent trip. To my surprise and delight the skies parted for a moment and a beautiful sunrise over the lake enthralled me with its serenity.The rest of the drive was completed in ever worsening conditions; the last 21mi to the Lake Ozette trailhead was on 3-4 inches of fresh, powdery snow and took me 50min! The rain and cold were out in full force so I bundled up; of course, pretty soon, as I warmed up I had to de-layer, which is never fun when you’re getting wet. Slippery boardwalks, made slipperier by slushy snow made for careful walking.My aim was to head to Cape Alava, then south along the beach to Sand Point and then loop back to the trailhead. After walking through some uninspiring forest - most unlike the Olymipcs - things opened up somewhat as I walked through the shrubbery of Ahlstroms Prairie. A coating of fresh powdery snow made for pretty hiking and took my mind off the otherwise dreary conditions.An hour after starting I was at the beach, or should I say giant rock field. It was low tide and the ocean was a long way away. On a better day I would have braved the slippery rocks to make my way to it but on this trip I was content to only wander a few dozen yards or so towards it. Grey clouds massed far and wide along the distant horizon and I was struck once more by how the mightiest mountain pales to insignificance against the immensity of the ocean.I love the beach, since it can be such an interesting place. This stretch of the Washington coast was different from others I have been on – much more cluttered. My initial surprise was soon replaced by anticipation. Pretty little pools, mossy greenery and other little treasures lurked amongst the rocks. Ozette Island and jagged sea-stacks rose up from the ocean, lending interest to the near horizon. The only regret I had was that photography was quite difficult, since in the swirling rain even an umbrella was useless in protecting the camera; I took a few snaps here and there but all were of the hurried, anxious variety.I made my way south along the beach and was soon at Wedding Rock, where I spent a happy few moments hunting for petroglyphs. I found a few here and there, but I think I need to return at some point to find some of the more interesting ones.By now the beach walk had become decidedly less rock-strewn and I made much smoother progress. Pretty soon Sand Point was in sight and as if to celebrate the moment the rain let up for a bit. However, as I reached the point and climbed up a grassy sea-stack, I was met by a driving, biting wind, armed with fangs of ice pellets. The views from the sea-stack were superb – some of the best I’ve seen. The coastline receded away from me in both directions on one side, while the ocean was littered with jagged rocky outcrops on the other. Pity, I could only spend 5min up there, before I was chased down by the cold wind.The rest of the hike, back to the car, was straight-forward. The drive back was also much quicker, since all of the snow on the roads had melted.Additional photos: http://www.flickr.com/[…]/72157612172035262Cumulative stats:- Distance: 9.5mi- Elevation gain: 500ft- Hiking time: 4.5hrs- Trip time: 16.25hrsnan',\n",
       " 969: \"great day trip. lots of different off trails. started off behind a noisy family and branched of within 5 minutes and were on our own. the little Creek wet land area was blocked off and dry. we hiked 2.25 hours never backtracked at a good pace and didn't see everything. lots of beautiful mushrooms. saw a rabbit. saw a few squirrels. very well marked at almost every fork. kid friendly. couple spots of horse manure. saw horses and mountain bikes at the head but never in the trails. this is easy but nice.THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS DELIGHTFUL AS THE FALL FOLIAGE WAS REACHING ITS PEAK.  THE WEATHER WAS RAIN AND A A GOOD CHANCE OF MORE RAIN.  MY DESTINATION WAS SAND POINT ON THE  OLYMPIC COAST.  MY FRIEND AND I HEARD ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL THE AREA WAS AND COULD HARDLY HOLD BACK OUR EXCITEMENT.  WE COULD'NT WAIT TO GET ONE WITH NATURE.  WE REACHED THE OZETTE RANGER STATION TO FIND ONLY ONE CAR.  GREAT NEWS, SOLITUDE!! THE WEATHER WAS CHANGING TO PARTLY CLOUDY AS OUR TRIP TO SAND POINT STARTED.  WE ARRIVED AT SAND POINT TO FIND WHAT SEEMED TO BE TWO PEOPLE CURSING.  BEWARE!!  THEIR FOOD WAS TAKEN, ALL OF IT!!  YES, THE RACCOONS WERE TERRIBLE!  THEY TOOK OURS TOO!! THAT NIGHT WE HUNG OUR FOOD AS PRESCRIBED,  TWELVE FEET HIGH, FOUR FEET DOWN AND SECURED IN A ZIPPER BAG.  THE FIRST NIGHT I AWOKE TO SOUNDS I CAN BEST DESCRIBE AS A GROUP OF CASTAWAYS HAVING THEIR FIRST MEAL AFTER BEING RESCUED.  I UNZIPPED MY TENT TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.  TO MY AMAZEMENT I SAW ELEVEN RACCOONS, SEVEN ADULTS AND FOUR YOUNG STUDENTS. I SAY STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKING NOTES.  ONE RACCOON WAS DANGLING FROM THE ROPE WITH BOTH LEGS ATTACHED AND WITH ONE ARM HE HAD REACHED THE BAG OF FOOD AND HAD UNZIPPED IT AND WAS THROWING FOOD TO THE BOTTOM WHERE THEY WERE GATTHERING FOR LATER CONSUMPTION.  THEY WERE RACCOONS ON TOP OF EACH OTHERS SHOULDER IN ORDER TO REACH THE ROPE USING THE TREE AS LEVERAGE.  WE RAN OUT OF OUR TENTS TO COUNT OUR LOSSES. THREE BAGS OF DEHYDRATED FOOD, ONE BAG OF TRAIL MIX, FOURS BAGS OF INSTANT CEREAL AND ALL OF MY COFFEE. THE FOOD WAS EXPENDABLE BUT THE COFFEE, WELL THAT HURT BAD!!! MY WARNING TO ALL OF YOU IS TO GET THE MOVIE ALIENS.  I CONSIDER THIS AS AN EXCELLENT TRAINING TAPE FOR SAND POINT!!  BE REAL SCARED!! HAPPY HALOWEEN!!     RACCOON EXPERT\",\n",
       " 970: \"Have you ever noticed that the ocean whispers in harmonious rhythm with the rush of rivers and the rustle of trees on the highest mountain peaks? A definite string of things, that initially seems separate but upon further inspection, the same.   My solitary three day stay in our Northwestern corner of Washington delivered this continuous awareness, as I huffed up overland trails by rope and wandered amongst the clear cuts and high tide seaweed soaked beach decorated by trees sculpted by time and rocks marked by those that came many years before me along the nine mile Cape Alva to Sand Point loop, from Ozette.I headed for the coast with the weather prediction crying for rain. Ocean wetness a given, the rain that did indeed eventually arrive, merely highlighted the experience.  The trail began on boardwalk (caution-slippery when wet and some broken or rotting boards) and continued for just over three easy miles to the coast; thus lending itself to quiet contemplation and a steady beat to match my surroundings. Colorful mushrooms dotted the second generation forest, pungent with its perfume, alluding to the near arrival of fall. Tasty salal berries bulged larger than I have seen in years.  They too, have blossomed from the bright light this season has so generously supplied.I was fortunate to enjoy a balance of sun; a gift deeply revered when beaming through cloudy sky.  To quote Mary Oliver, I “let the soft animal of my body love what it loves”. I told the ocean my secrets and it swallowed them whole with utmost care and cradled me in its timeless grandeur of past and present mixing with the tide. I sat and relished the massive body of water before me-lounging about in silky sand. Wispy clouds and golden twinkles intertwined upon its mysterious surface…still, the rhythm.Many people came before me here; they left their carvings in the rock.  Many people will come after I am gone.  This journey lent a theme of oneness amongst all things from land to sea, earth to sky, human to nature and other human beings. Sometimes, we isolate ourselves from the scheme of things…sometimes we think we are separate.  Sometimes we are.  And sometimes, the tranquility of life reminds us in the words of Colin Ray that were shared with me by a beautiful friend: “I laugh, I love, I hope I try, I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry. And I know you do the same things too, So we’re really not that different, me and you”.Namaste.  May you find the pulse that connects the string of all things in our magnificent Northwest backyard!This was an absolutely beautiful hike. The trail for the most part was in good condition, although you did have to really watch your step on the boardwalk parts of the trail as they were really slippery from the rain a few days before we got there. We took the Sand Point part of the trail and stayed the night at Sand Point before venturing north along the beach to Cape Alava. We were quite lucky to find a number of the rock carvings along the way and we stopped for lunch/snacks once we got to Cape Alava. There wasn't much potable water along the way so we packed in our water for the overnight trip. All in all it was a fantastic and memorable trip having never been there before.\",\n",
       " 971: \"We decided to go on the Ozette triangle as an overnight girls hike, wanting to try a shorter backpacking hike for those of us new to overnight hiking. Completely recommend it - so much fun and incredibly pretty!\\r First things first - you need to go to a ranger station to get an overnight pass and make reservations at one of the campgrounds well in advance. We got our pass the week of (in the middle of August) and the Sand Point campground was full, so we ended up getting a reservation at the South Sand Point campground, which is about a half a mile down the beach from the first campground. It ended up being the best thing though as we were completed isolated from everyone else. This is a remote area, but it's also a relatively easy and busy/popular hike, thus there are plenty of people at both Sand Point and Cape Alava campgrounds. We ended up camping down at the trailhead for the Ozette Lake trail that had it's own pit toilet and no one else around - the best location!!\\r As for the trail itself, we chose to go counter clockwise and head down to Cape Alava first. The 3 miles down to the beach is easy, with very little elevation change. Once you get to the beach and Cape Alava campground though, that's when the going gets a bit slower. As you're fighting the tide, you need to hustle to get around the two main points, which can be a bit difficult as you're going between sand and slick rocks. With packs on, we really only averaged about 1 mile/hr on the beach, so give yourself 3 hours to do the beach portion, with an extra few minutes to check out the beautiful wedding rocks in the middle. \\r Once we got to the Sand Point campground, we stopped to find the creek so that we could filter and stock up on water. This time of year, the creek is pretty stagnant and nasty - we only filtered enough to cook for dinner (which we then tried to boil the crap out of - literally), determining that we could stretch the rest of our drinking water to last the next day. If going in August, I would recommend each person bring enough drinking water for both days. And wine - bring enough wine!\\r We had absolutely GORGEOUS weather. For those unfamiliar with the Washington coast, this is a rarity and something that should be revered. The only disappointment was that the clouds rolled in at night and we weren't able to stargaze. As this is considered one of the darkest places in the US, free from almost all light pollution, I was a bit bummed. BUT, all the more reason to go back. \\r The next day, we headed up the other side of the trail at Sand Point, which is the third 3 mile leg of the trip.

Used Canon Powershot, iPhone, and Canon Rebel.)\\rSo our backpacking journey started off late...\\rNot necessarily the best way to start any day and/or trip. You see, the bf works on the weekends (nightlife industry) on top of his other career during the week. So of course he had to help plan and execute the official HIN afterparty that was held at a club in our metro downtown area. Once he came back home I could tell he was obviously exhausted. Though he kept saying we were going to start the day at 4 am. I had a slight feeling that  it wasn\\'t going to happen (poor guy lol). In the end we were up and out the parking garage by 9am T_T. We arrived at the grandparent\\'s and dropped our kiddo off.. Gave our lil\\' guy kisses and hugs but he didn\\'t seem too interested. =P Because he was clearly distracted by his grandparent\\'s\\' and his toys. =D Erik and I are baby free at this point. It was a bittersweet feeling but we know that we both deserve and need this alone time to explore and have fun together since it\\'s not often that he gets time to be out and about due to his work schedule. So of course you know what we do? We make sure we take advantage of that time and enjoy the heck out of it while we can before it\\'s back to reality and responsibilities. . After almost 4 hrs of impatient driving and a pit stop to the Wilderness Information Center (http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/wic.htm) we finally made it to our starting point.\\rParked our vehicle, finished doing a last minute inspection of what our packs contained.  It is very vital that you bring a sufficient supply of water unless you plan on bringing your own filtration system..If not, bring a kettle and boil your H2O. We got rid of our old water filtration system. So I personally brought a kettle.\\rI can\\'t exactly describe in words how this trip made me feel to it\\'s core. But I can tell you that this was something magical. The feeling you get is so different compared to Kalaloch (Another favorite spot of ours).  They both have their majestic feels.  It\\'s a different world out here to say the least.  Seriously a must on your \"Bucket List\".  You really don\\'t realize how beautiful Washington truly is until you explore it. =)\\r  Would I go back? Uhmmm yes! The best part of the entire trip was being able to camp out under the glittery galaxy.  Stargazing and witnessing a vivid sunset and sun disk just felt so euphoric. I\\'m still in aweeee.

Even though it was \"Spring Break\" there were only a few campers at Alava, and we set up at a camp about 8 sites up from the bridge.  A seal carcass on the beach was getting the full attention of several bald eagles, two osprey, many gulls and crows, and that provided entertainment for all three days (see pic).  Also, a decomposed whale was on the shore of the little island just north of the ranger cabin that is accessible at low tide.  Part of the spine was intact near a blob of what looked like a giant (about 8 feet across) jellyfish, and several partially bleached vertebrae and rib bones were nearby (see pic). Of course the deer wandered through several times a day and the racoons made noises at night but stayed out of our camp. A hummingbird or two also kept us company. Not too much debris in the way of floats, but a couple of blue barrels and a large piece of culvert await the beach cleanup crew(s).   The boardwalk is in pretty good shape, with lots of new sections.Cape Alava Loop is well worth a afternoon or weekend visit. We opted for a overnight stay.I had heard tales about the boardwalk for years so whene a buddy emailed and said he wanted to head out there I was game. We arrived at the trailhead at about 3 pm there were a good 15 cars in the enormous parking lot.The boardwalk was a bit uneventfull a few slips but no falls. There is not a whole lot to see on the 3 miles on out to the ocean-but it seems like a preety short 3 miles because hiking the boards are so repetitive.It was a beautiful sunny March afternoon and there were numerous people camped up at Cape Alava along the high tide line. We opted to steer clear of these crowds and headed south to a neat little spot just before you get to Sand Point. There happened to be a little water source right there and 3 very friendly deer. (There not much fresh water available from Cape Alava to Sand Point)There sure was not as much sandy beach as I was used to after hiking the Kalaloch beaches and Third Beach down to Goodman Creek but the tidal rockery was a change of scenery. It seemed the big white sea lions liked the area---there were a bunch of them lying around.We got up early on Saturday and headed out as the rain started falling. There was not a whole lot to see as we headed out the Sand Point leg of the trail either, but after a short 50 min hike we were at the trailhead.No reservtions needed. Plenty of fees.

       "'It was a beautiful day for a hike, even though the weather report, which promised only a 10% chance of rain, LIED!  We reached the trailhead around 8:30.  It was empty!  Being the first people to a trailhead is, I swear, one of the greatest joys of life.  We packed up, laced up and headed out.\\r The trail climbs via switchbacks to the top of a ridge line right off the bat, but that\\'s really the only gain for the rest of the four miles in to Camp Comfort.  One of the things I like about this particular trail is the fact that there is water, water everywhere. Many small streams to cross (some trickier than others, particularly since it\\'s still early in the season, but none insurmountable), the river close for most of the trail.  The Skokomish is a beautiful river along this stretch.  Swift and clear, she\\'s quick to erode banks and there is a part of the trail that was there last year and has fallen into the river this  year.  But, it\\'s easy to scootch along the edge at a safe distance.\\r The moss is always delightful along this trail and did not disappoint.  It\\'s impossible to count all of the shades of green that dazzle the senses.\\r We clambered over and under quite a few fallen trees, remnants of winter storms.  It\\'s early in the season...WTA work groups have yet to hit the trail (I always realize just how much I appreciate those hard-working volunteers when we\\'re on a trail that has yet-to-be-cleared).\\r We reached Camp Comfort and headed down to the river, where we pulled up a large log and enjoyed our picnic lunch.  After enjoying the views we packed it in and headed back.  We ran into maybe a couple dozen people the entire day, which is always a treat.  We did get rained on a bit as we hiked back out, but even that was delightful as it we\\'d get light rain, then the sun would come back out, then light rain.  The green became greener...and sparkly...and the bit of rain only made things that much prettier.\\r All in all, two enthusiastic thumbs up!Road is snow free all the way.  Just some bad potholes the last 5-6 miles.Only saw 3 other hikers.  Snow gets a foot deep in places, but it was cool enough that I did not sink so I never used my spikes or snowshoes.  Bridge area is cordoned off at end of hike, but you can see the new bridge from the trail before that point - NICE!  Finally, the loop will be available again.One downed tree near the start with an easy detour.Video of hike on YouTube:http://youtu.be/hQu2X3wSawkA gentle mist fell on us, as we spent the day doing trail re-routes, and removing fallen trees from the trail.  The lake trail is in good shape (now) and provides awesome views of a fast running river. The road in is great, and the bathrooms at the day use area are heated (in case you needed to change out of wet clothes from the gentle mist).I could not post here until I logged off Facebook because a window that would not close opened up and blocked my view.I started at the dam and hiked north working my way around the lake counter-clock-wiseThis was a long cold hike since the river ford was waist deep.  The trail has not seen any visible work in years other than nice new signs.  Since the trail navigates a maze of logging roads it is VERY good that it is well signed.  This is probably not a destination trail but gives one lots of solitude in the winter.  I think it would be very noisy in the summer with campers everywhere and boats on the lake. There are a lot of very nice bridges on this trail, but one looked like it was about to fall and another spot looked like it used to have a bridge.  It was diffcult to find the trail after I forded the Wynoochee river due to alders growing up on the bank and lack of use.\\xa0A detailed trip report with lots of pictures is at:http://mosswalks.blogspot.com/[…]/wynoochee-lakeshore-trail.htmlThe road to Staircase is in good condition. There are some potholes, especially after the causeway over the inlet of Lake Cushman, but any car can make it easily, and LOTS of them did on this warm, sunny holiday weekend.\\r The popular Staircase Rapids Loop is problem-free and once again possible with a new (2 yrs old) bridge to make a lovely, 2-mile loop.\\r The North Fork Skokomish trail continues straight past the bridge junction, wandering as far into the Olympics as one is prepared to go. Pics are at the link below. No dogs or bikes are allowed on this hiker and stock trail. \\r There are some downed trees, most of which are easy to step over. One huge Doug fir at around 2 miles is easy for hikers to duck under but might pose a problem for stock. Another tree that fell lengthwise over part of the trail just before Big Log Camp might prevent stock access, although hikers were camped at Big Log with llamas – I’d have liked to see how they negotiated that spot. There is some water and mud on the trail as one would expect, nothing deep. All creek fords except one have a footbridge or better. The water was not running high or fast considering the season (this and the utter lack of snow even on surrounding peaks was disconcerting). \\r This is a lovely, Olympics trail with options to turn off for Flapjack Lakes, Six Ridge, and destinations beyond. We turned around at Camp Pleasant, about 6.5 miles in. We didn’t start until after 9 a.m. and lingered in several spots, making it back to Staircase around 4:30 after a soul-massage of 14 miles and 1,600’ gain.With it cloudy and threatening to rain in Seattle, I thought I would try my luck on the Olympic Peninsula.I was greeted by the Sun and the road graders, which were filling in the pot holes on the road leading to the trailhead. I was very happy to see this work being done.I met several families at the trailhead, but only one followed the trail along the river with me.The river was running fast and the sound it made was very calming.Though the trail to the bridge was closed; you could see from the river that progress was being made. Work is also being done to clear/fix up the trail. It doesn’t look like it will be much longer before this trail is a loop again.This was an easy hike and I enjoyed this hike along the river very much.The bridge at the 1/2 way mark of the \\'Rapids Loop Trail\\' has been rebuilt.The potholes getting to the trailhead were slightly ridiculous and completely unavoidable, however I still got there. The entry fee, if you don\\'t have a pass had to be paid by the campground but the trail head was up the way a little. The trail itself was beautiful, even in the rain. The rovers were running high so one of the foot bridges didn\\'t completely cross the water, but it was passable. Gorgeous hike, highly recommend!Returning to the Skok is visiting a familiar friend, immediately comfortable and relaxing. This sunny February Thursday was particularly lovely. The snow lingers only on the surrounding peaks, and the promise of spring permeated the air, punctuated by birdsong and translucent green rush of the snowmelt-swollen river. Ahhhh. \\r Ok, I\\'ll stop waxing wordy and convey information. The gravel part of the road has some doozies of potholes along the recent clearcut. With care, any car can make it. Except that bit, the road\\'s good. Privy at the trailhead, NW Forest Pass required. \\r We hiked from the lower trailhead to Homestead Camp, wandered and snoozed on the river bank, then returned via the 140 access. This makes a great 5 mile loop with about 800\\' elevation gain. \\r Though there are a few trees down, none is an issue. However, at about 1 mile in, the river took a large bite of trail. The narrow part left is fine for hikers but iffy for stock. It will need a re-route. The streams crossing the trail are at spring volume with significant erosion on a couple. I took my boots off to ford one, but it was more from a desire to wade than necessity. \\r Reroute at Homestead Camp is holding up great, and the 140 has only three wrist-diameter trees over it and one area becoming eroded. Though still wide, it did take out one of the side logs put alongside the trail near one of the new bridges. Might bear taking a look at. \\r A beautiful hike. And, baby lambs and llamas on the drive there!Road to Staircase closed due to washout about one mile from parking lot.\\nThere is no vehicle access in to the Staircase area, but the National Forest road is open all the way to the washout, which is just past the turnoff for the causeway road that crosses the top of Lake Cushman. There is room to park on the roadside near the washout, and it\\'s an easy walk in to access the trails from there. We only went in as far as bridge adjacent to the parking lot, so can\\'t comment on trail conditions at all-- but the road walk in was beautiful, quiet, and very pleasant!The road from the Big Creek Campground entrance all the way to the Park boundry to the Staircase Campground (7 miles) is in HORRIBLE shape. Even in a 3/4 ton 4x4 truck I felt like had been kidney punched a hundred plus times in the nearly 1 hour it took me to bounce my way to the entrance. The condition of this heavily used access road to such a highly coveted trail system is a shameful disgrace to our National Park Service and should be addressed immediately. That being said I do not recommend going here until this road is made more serviceable or be prepared to need repairs to your vehicle as some of these enormous potholes are not only very big, they are also very deep, deceptive and unavoidable. You have been warned..\\rIf you can get to the entrance the parking lot had a minimal amount of snow/ice but nothing any vehicle could not make short order of.\\rI started off across the bridge towards the Big Cedar spur trail but before I could even get that far I happened across a family of 4 Elk out for a morning stroll and grazing. They were absolutely beautiful,a bit camera shy and timid but a very welcome sight. The trail was a little icy and slippery in places but nothing a little careful navigation cannot overcome. There are some windfalls cross the trail that you can either go around or climb over. The east side of the river trail a small creek had turned into a raging river that looked a bit too dangerous to cross so I turned around and backtracked my way back out. \\rOverall I still love the Staircase Rapids hike but the road conditions right now do not make this trip worth the damage and wear to your vehicle to go see. I would hope they will service this road a restore the publics enjoyment of this wonderful area soon.We love this hike in every season - but, this year I recommend waiting until the road is repaired. See Wheeln\\'s trip report. Sounds like they went out on Saturday and we tried on Sunday. I wish I had read it before we headed out. We made it as far as the Mount Rose trail head before having to turn around.a crossing on the northwest side is washed out. here\\'s a youtube episode with a little bit of the experience.The Staircase area has some snow, but on a sunny day, it was pleasant walking up the north and south side of the Skokomish River from the road end. Normally, I would have walked the loop and crossed the river on the footbridge, but the weather has been very hard on this area, and the bridge has been washed away. So I hiked up and back on the south side, explored a side trail to the biggest fallen cedar I have ever seen, and then hiked up the north side to the bridge washout. It was twice as far as it would have been with the bridge in place, but well worth the effort. You could keep going on the north side to really stretch your legs, as there is only 3 or 4 inches of snow, no need for snowshoes at this elevation. It is worth the trip just for the solitude, which the guru was craving on this gorgeous winter day. There were a couple of minor blowdowns that were easily crossed. Somebody can let us know when the bridge is repaired.this was a great hike, very pretty. it was one of those hikes you should take guests from out of town to show off Washington. so many nice views! the road getting here was rough, but not impossible to drive. my Honda CRV made it just fine, you just have to be careful and navigate your tires around the potholes.2 friends and I did this loop recently and it was awesome! Super easy, walking through beautiful moss covered foliage the entire time and you can\\'t beat the view of the rapids the entire way. We\\'re all nursing a lower body injury of some sort and didn\\'t have a problem on this trail. **Make sure you take the path to the right after the bridge! We took a left and walked 2 miles uphill into heavier snow until running into a backpacker who warned us that we would have kept going in that same direction for days, haha!!A rare beautiful day in the PNW in the middle of winter practically begged a person to be outside. My friend and I a arrived at the trailhead at about 9 am with only one other car arriving alongside us. Gearing up we found that my camelback had tried to make a jail break from my backseat, only to end up leaking all over it. Thankfully it looked much worse than it actually was, and I still had plenty of water for the day. We started out on the trail, and as expected the first 1/2 to first mile was mostly incline, but the trail was manageable with only one or two trees to maneuver over. At about a mile and a half the trail became flooded for about 100 feet. If you don’t bring some tall muck boots, a change of socks or waterproof footwear, be prepared to get creative in your balancing act skills as there are some logs to walk along to avoid the swamp. I’m not one for advocating walking off trail unless there is a way to do so without damaging anything. After that the trail is good to go. After some carefully and strategically placed foot crossing over some small over flowing creeks, we turned around at about 4.5 miles (according to my Garmin watch). We made it almost all the way back to the car before my friend ended up losing her footing on one crossing and ended up with a soaked left foot, and I have since dubbed her a hiking name of “Left Foot.” All in all it was a beautiful day to be out on the trail.I DID NOT REACH THE TRAIL...\\r When you come to the \"T\" at Big Creek, and take a left to go towards Staircase, the road shortly thereafter turns into dirt / gravel. About 1/4 mile into the dirt road, the potholes appear. These aren\\'t your standard potholes on the way to trails, these things are 2ft-7ft wide by 2ft-4ft long by 6in-18in deep. AND ALL OVER THE PLACE. As previous people have mentioned, they\\'re completely unavoidable. \\r After driving through these in my F150 for mile, I realized I still had 7-8 miles to go before I even got to the trailhead. It wasn\\'t worth it, so I turned around. This road is MISERABLE right now.Nice river hike.  Lots of moss, ferns, some big trees, and frequent river views/access on the Staircase side of the river.  The other side of the river provided a nice contrast with larger trees, less moss, and less river access.  I went a little beyond the bridge on the Staircase side of the river, but I\\'m not sure if I made it to Four Stream.  The description makes it sound like it would be difficult to ford, but the ford that I turned around at looked pretty easy, assuming that you had some extra foot wear and didn\\'t mind the temperature of the water.  The trail on the other side was obvious, but I can\\'t say how far it went.  Maps imply that it wouldn\\'t go too far.There were a couple of blowdowns, but nothing too bad.  There was one section where a small waterfall was flowing over the trail.  I was glad to have poles there because of the slippery uneven rock.  I think that may have been beyond the bridge on the way to Four Stream, so you wouldn\\'t need to do that section for the loop.'"

       "'Mount RoseMy wife and I started at the trailhead at noon on May 4th. The weather was perfect at around 70 degrees. I wasn\\'t prepared for the difficulty of this climb, and only got to the commemorative sign before turning back due to snow covering the trail a few hundred yards above. I was also exhausted! Our kids are 11, 16 and 19 and would not have been able to do this hike so we were glad they had stayed home. We plan on trying again in June with better boots and possibly some hiking poles. A quiet uncrowded hike but steep. Tried this hike a few weeks back and just got to \"horse camp\". Today decided, go slow, lots of water (hot day) and make it to the top! We did it in 3.5 hours round trip! Coming down is a lot faster. Saw some very spry young folks hiking with no sticks, bounding up and back in way less time. Encountered some backpackers doing conditioning hikes. \\rMy big question is when you are almost to horse camp, what is that noise? Husband always says it is a bear, hear it every time! I am ruling out bear,bird, tree tops rubbing. Sound sort of like a puffing bird in a log, or frog. Anyone know this mystery sound ?\\rGlad I made it yet again on this crazy hike....got some good sweat and burn in....I headed out and when I made a wrong turn on some road I saw the trail head and decided to go up it. I got kinda a late start for not knowing where I was going, or to where the trail lead. I was planning on staying the night, so when night fell I would just find a place to set up my hammock at, re hydrate some food and kick back and read a book while enjoying the great outdoors.The trail was in excelent condition. It almsot seemed to be too good. It was steep, and there was quite a few switchbacks, but I guess thats what you get for doing a trail that starts with \"\"Mt.\"\" It was nothing that I couldn\\'t handle. It was a overcast day, so the view wasn\\'t all that good, but I could see Lake Cushman off and on.I got to the big rock... I think where the trail junction in. I sat down to take a break and while doing so realized that I forgot a few of the items that I have always been taught to check, and double check before you start out. Matches and Toliet Paper. So... I decided to head back down. I can live with out matches but the toliet paper... :) I was able to jog most of the way down make some good time. Using my treking poles to round the steep corners with out having to slow down much.All in all it was a good hike, even though I was unable to make it to the top. I am going to have to go back in about a week and try again.This is a beautiful hike! The trailhead starts near the shore of Lake Cushman and you can get some good peeks at the beautiful lake on the way up. There was a small patch or 2 of snow on the summit loop, but they were easily passable. Great view at the top, but it was chilly up there, so bring a layer even though it\\'s much warmer below.The famously steep Mt. Rose trail, featuring a hefty 3500\\' of elevation gain, is in good condition up to Horse Camp. Heavy snow covers part of the final 1.1 mile climb to the summit - it will take several weeks to melt it all. Scattered bits of flag tape mark the path of the trail in the snow, but you might want to take along a GPS unit to help with navigation.  The summit area of Mt. Rose is free of snow and perfect for enjoying the vertiginous view down to Lake Cushman.We hiked the alternate trail down from Mount Rose and found extensive snow cover with a few bare areas on the ridge line that this trail initially follows. Heavy snow covers the trail where it drops off the ridge, but orange markers nailed to the trees help with navigation here. The snow ends about 400 feet down,  and much of the trail is free of snow down to Horse Camp. Some blowdowns need clearing.'"

      "Mount RoseMy wife and I started at the trailhead at noon on May 4th. The weather was perfect at around 70 degrees. I wasn't prepared for the difficulty of this climb, and only got to the commemorative sign before turning back due to snow covering the trail a few hundred yards above. I was also exhausted! Our kids are 11, 16 and 19 and would not have been able to do this hike so we were glad they had stayed home. We plan on trying again in June with better boots and possibly some hiking poles. A quiet uncrowded hike but steep. \n",
      "Tried this hike a few weeks back and just got to \"horse camp\". Today decided, go slow, lots of water (hot day) and make it to the top! We did it in 3.5 hours round trip! Coming down is a lot faster. Saw some very spry young folks hiking with no sticks, bounding up and back in way less time. Encountered some backpackers doing conditioning hikes. \r",
      "My big question is when you are almost to horse camp, what is that noise? Husband always says it is a bear, hear it every time! I am ruling out bear,bird, tree tops rubbing. Sound sort of like a puffing bird in a log, or frog. Anyone know this mystery sound ?\r",
      "Glad I made it yet again on this crazy hike....got some good sweat and burn in....\n",
      "I headed out and when I made a wrong turn on some road I saw the trail head and decided to go up it. I got kinda a late start for not knowing where I was going, or to where the trail lead. I was planning on staying the night, so when night fell I would just find a place to set up my hammock at, re hydrate some food and kick back and read a book while enjoying the great outdoors.The trail was in excelent condition. It almsot seemed to be too good. It was steep, and there was quite a few switchbacks, but I guess thats what you get for doing a trail that starts with \"\"Mt.\"\" It was nothing that I couldn't handle. It was a overcast day, so the view wasn't all that good, but I could see Lake Cushman off and on.I got to the big rock... I think where the trail junction in. I sat down to take a break and while doing so realized that I forgot a few of the items that I have always been taught to check, and double check before you start out. Matches and Toliet Paper. So... I decided to head back down. I can live with out matches but the toliet paper... :) I was able to jog most of the way down make some good time. Using my treking poles to round the steep corners with out having to slow down much.All in all it was a good hike, even though I was unable to make it to the top. I am going to have to go back in about a week and try again.\n",
      "This is a beautiful hike! The trailhead starts near the shore of Lake Cushman and you can get some good peeks at the beautiful lake on the way up. There was a small patch or 2 of snow on the summit loop, but they were easily passable. Great view at the top, but it was chilly up there, so bring a layer even though it's much warmer below.\n",
      "The famously steep Mt. Rose trail, featuring a hefty 3500' of elevation gain, is in good condition up to Horse Camp. Heavy snow covers part of the final 1.1 mile climb to the summit - it will take several weeks to melt it all. Scattered bits of flag tape mark the path of the trail in the snow, but you might want to take along a GPS unit to help with navigation.  The summit area of Mt. Rose is free of snow and perfect for enjoying the vertiginous view down to Lake Cushman.We hiked the alternate trail down from Mount Rose and found extensive snow cover with a few bare areas on the ridge line that this trail initially follows. Heavy snow covers the trail where it drops off the ridge, but orange markers nailed to the trees help with navigation here. The snow ends about 400 feet down,  and much of the trail is free of snow down to Horse Camp. Some blowdowns need clearing.\n"
