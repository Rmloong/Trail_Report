       "'Mount RoseMy wife and I started at the trailhead at noon on May 4th. The weather was perfect at around 70 degrees. I wasn\\'t prepared for the difficulty of this climb, and only got to the commemorative sign before turning back due to snow covering the trail a few hundred yards above. I was also exhausted! Our kids are 11, 16 and 19 and would not have been able to do this hike so we were glad they had stayed home. We plan on trying again in June with better boots and possibly some hiking poles. A quiet uncrowded hike but steep. Tried this hike a few weeks back and just got to \"horse camp\". Today decided, go slow, lots of water (hot day) and make it to the top! We did it in 3.5 hours round trip! Coming down is a lot faster. Saw some very spry young folks hiking with no sticks, bounding up and back in way less time. Encountered some backpackers doing conditioning hikes. \\rMy big question is when you are almost to horse camp, what is that noise? Husband always says it is a bear, hear it every time! I am ruling out bear,bird, tree tops rubbing. Sound sort of like a puffing bird in a log, or frog. Anyone know this mystery sound ?\\rGlad I made it yet again on this crazy hike....got some good sweat and burn in....I headed out and when I made a wrong turn on some road I saw the trail head and decided to go up it. I got kinda a late start for not knowing where I was going, or to where the trail lead. I was planning on staying the night, so when night fell I would just find a place to set up my hammock at, re hydrate some food and kick back and read a book while enjoying the great outdoors.The trail was in excelent condition. It almsot seemed to be too good. It was steep, and there was quite a few switchbacks, but I guess thats what you get for doing a trail that starts with \"\"Mt.\"\" It was nothing that I couldn\\'t handle. It was a overcast day, so the view wasn\\'t all that good, but I could see Lake Cushman off and on.I got to the big rock... I think where the trail junction in. I sat down to take a break and while doing so realized that I forgot a few of the items that I have always been taught to check, and double check before you start out. Matches and Toliet Paper. So... I decided to head back down. I can live with out matches but the toliet paper... :) I was able to jog most of the way down make some good time. Using my treking poles to round the steep corners with out having to slow down much.All in all it was a good hike, even though I was unable to make it to the top. I am going to have to go back in about a week and try again.This is a beautiful hike! The trailhead starts near the shore of Lake Cushman and you can get some good peeks at the beautiful lake on the way up. There was a small patch or 2 of snow on the summit loop, but they were easily passable. Great view at the top, but it was chilly up there, so bring a layer even though it\\'s much warmer below.The famously steep Mt. Rose trail, featuring a hefty 3500\\' of elevation gain, is in good condition up to Horse Camp. Heavy snow covers part of the final 1.1 mile climb to the summit - it will take several weeks to melt it all. Scattered bits of flag tape mark the path of the trail in the snow, but you might want to take along a GPS unit to help with navigation.  The summit area of Mt. Rose is free of snow and perfect for enjoying the vertiginous view down to Lake Cushman.We hiked the alternate trail down from Mount Rose and found extensive snow cover with a few bare areas on the ridge line that this trail initially follows. Heavy snow covers the trail where it drops off the ridge, but orange markers nailed to the trees help with navigation here. The snow ends about 400 feet down,  and much of the trail is free of snow down to Horse Camp. Some blowdowns need clearing.'"

      "Mount RoseMy wife and I started at the trailhead at noon on May 4th. The weather was perfect at around 70 degrees. I wasn't prepared for the difficulty of this climb, and only got to the commemorative sign before turning back due to snow covering the trail a few hundred yards above. I was also exhausted! Our kids are 11, 16 and 19 and would not have been able to do this hike so we were glad they had stayed home. We plan on trying again in June with better boots and possibly some hiking poles. A quiet uncrowded hike but steep. \n",
      "Tried this hike a few weeks back and just got to \"horse camp\". Today decided, go slow, lots of water (hot day) and make it to the top! We did it in 3.5 hours round trip! Coming down is a lot faster. Saw some very spry young folks hiking with no sticks, bounding up and back in way less time. Encountered some backpackers doing conditioning hikes. \r",
      "My big question is when you are almost to horse camp, what is that noise? Husband always says it is a bear, hear it every time! I am ruling out bear,bird, tree tops rubbing. Sound sort of like a puffing bird in a log, or frog. Anyone know this mystery sound ?\r",
      "Glad I made it yet again on this crazy hike....got some good sweat and burn in....\n",
      "I headed out and when I made a wrong turn on some road I saw the trail head and decided to go up it. I got kinda a late start for not knowing where I was going, or to where the trail lead. I was planning on staying the night, so when night fell I would just find a place to set up my hammock at, re hydrate some food and kick back and read a book while enjoying the great outdoors.The trail was in excelent condition. It almsot seemed to be too good. It was steep, and there was quite a few switchbacks, but I guess thats what you get for doing a trail that starts with \"\"Mt.\"\" It was nothing that I couldn't handle. It was a overcast day, so the view wasn't all that good, but I could see Lake Cushman off and on.I got to the big rock... I think where the trail junction in. I sat down to take a break and while doing so realized that I forgot a few of the items that I have always been taught to check, and double check before you start out. Matches and Toliet Paper. So... I decided to head back down. I can live with out matches but the toliet paper... :) I was able to jog most of the way down make some good time. Using my treking poles to round the steep corners with out having to slow down much.All in all it was a good hike, even though I was unable to make it to the top. I am going to have to go back in about a week and try again.\n",
      "This is a beautiful hike! The trailhead starts near the shore of Lake Cushman and you can get some good peeks at the beautiful lake on the way up. There was a small patch or 2 of snow on the summit loop, but they were easily passable. Great view at the top, but it was chilly up there, so bring a layer even though it's much warmer below.\n",
      "The famously steep Mt. Rose trail, featuring a hefty 3500' of elevation gain, is in good condition up to Horse Camp. Heavy snow covers part of the final 1.1 mile climb to the summit - it will take several weeks to melt it all. Scattered bits of flag tape mark the path of the trail in the snow, but you might want to take along a GPS unit to help with navigation.  The summit area of Mt. Rose is free of snow and perfect for enjoying the vertiginous view down to Lake Cushman.We hiked the alternate trail down from Mount Rose and found extensive snow cover with a few bare areas on the ridge line that this trail initially follows. Heavy snow covers the trail where it drops off the ridge, but orange markers nailed to the trees help with navigation here. The snow ends about 400 feet down,  and much of the trail is free of snow down to Horse Camp. Some blowdowns need clearing.\n"
