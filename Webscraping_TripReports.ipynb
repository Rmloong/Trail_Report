We got to the lower trailhead just before 9PM and continued to the upper to see how it was. Just after the sharp left turn between the lower and upper trailhead we hit a couple feet of snow on the road that didn’t have tracks, so we returned to the lower lot.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0We got up early and rolled out just before 5:30AM. The trail had no snow until the switchbacks after the junction with the trail from the upper lot. It was soft but not mushy in the morning and both of us had mountaineering boots on. It became more consistent as we climbed through the forest until the whole trail was covered. We broke through the tree line and made it to the base of the gulley where we put on our crampons, put on helmets, and pulled out the ice axes. The gulley was pretty straight forward. One group was a little in front of us and we followed their tracks. The snow was pretty soft and we post holed some but it wasn’t too bad. I first felt that the crampons were overkill but I was happy to have them for additional traction.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0We passed the group where the gulley levels out a bit, then made the push to the bowl above. Neither of us had been before so we were surprised with the false summit. We continued to the left up a small hill, traversed the little ridge, and made the final summit push to be the first to top out that day.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The top was incredible! It was clear and sunny. Two other small groups joined us at the top. We took pictures and then started down. We walked down the first little bit because the glissade chutes veered toward a drop off, but if we went again we agreed we would’ve glissaded that bit because the snow was so soft it’s easy to arrest. We glissaded down the whole gulley and passed a handful of people climbing up. We took off our extra gear and started walking back, passing a ton more once we got back into the tree line. We made good time back to the car and found that the lot was quite full. Epic summit day!</p>\\n<p>Note on gear: No doubt people can (and have) made it up this with gym shoes and regular workout clothes and nothing much else. We were very happy with our gear choices even if they may have been overkill. Crampons made it much easier in the soft snow and the ice axe is important for safety and glissading. We also had climbing helmets - I have a personal policy where I have my helmet on if my ice axe is out.\\xa0</p></div>\\n                    <a class=\"show-with-full full-report-link visualNoPrint hidden-480 wta-action button\" href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-05-06.7450718952\">\\n                        <img condition=\"hasPhotos\" src=\"https://www.wta.org/eye-white-on-blue.png\" />\\n                        See full trip report\\n                    </a>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n                \\n              \\n                \\n                  <div class=\"item\">\\n    <div class=\"item-row\">\\n        <div class=\"item-header\">\\n          <a class=\"listitem-title\" href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-05-06.5424003236\">\\n            Mount Ellinor\\n          </a>\\n          <h3 class=\"region\"><span class=\"region\">Olympic Peninsula -- Hood Canal</span></h3>\\n        </div>\\n\\n        <div class=\"col three\">\\n          <div class=\"listing-image\">\\n              <div class=\"thumb-background\">\\n                \\n              </div>\\n\\n              \\xa0\\n          </div>\\n          \\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"col nine\">\\n            \\n              <div class=\"CreatorInfo\">\\n                  <span>\\n                      <a href=\"https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-JunBug\">\\n                          <div class=\"avatar\" style=\"width: 30px; background-image: url(\\'https://www.wta.org/portal_memberdata/portraits/MrBGPati\\');\"></div>JunBug</a>\\n                  </span>\\n                  <div class=\"Badges\">\\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                  </div>\\n              </div>\\n            \\n            <p class=\"hike-date\">\\n              Hiked: <span class=\"elapsed-time\" title=\"May 05, 2018\">2 days ago</span>\\n            </p>\\n            <div class=\"trail-issues\">\\n              <strong>Beware of:</strong>\\n              road, snow conditions\\n            </div>\\n\\n            <div class=\"trip-report-stats\">\\n              <div class=\"trip-features\">\\n                \\n                \\xa0\\n              </div>\\n              \\n                <div class=\"upvote\">\\n                    \\xa0\\n                    <p><img src=\"https://www.wta.org/++theme++plonetheme.wta/images/svg/trail-icons/thumbs-up.svg\" /> <span class=\"UpvoteCount\">1</span> person found this report helpful</p>\\n                </div>\\n              \\n            </div>\\n\\n            <div class=\"clear\">\\xa0</div>\\n\\n            <div class=\"report-text show-excerpt\">\\n                <div>\\n                    <a href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-05-06.5424003236/@@tr_listitem?show_full=3d65f067e5e84a9bb2b196cb193822ad\" class=\"toggler\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n                       <span class=\"show-with-excerpt\">View report text</span>\\n                       <span class=\"show-with-full\">Hide report text</span>\\n                    </a>\\n                    <div class=\"show-with-full\"><p>Found women\\'s shoes and gaiters on May 5th, around 12:30 PM on the base of the chute.

The road is open to the lower trailhead, but has major potholes. It is still blocked by snow just beyond the lower trailhead. We used microspikes as boot tracks have beaten down a firm walking path in the snow. We left the parking lot at 7:30 am so the snow was still firm. The chute, where there were tacks, was firm enough so we had no difficulty. Getting out of the track resulted in post holing. CAUTION: The glissade track is not well defined yet and the snow is not firm enough to easily control a glissade. After attempting a glissade we elected to walk down. The snow was stable enough on Sunday, but if the weather significantly warms a wet snow avalanche could be triggered. I would be cautious if temperatures go up as forecasted later in the week.</p></div>\\n                    <a class=\"show-with-full full-report-link visualNoPrint hidden-480 wta-action button\" href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-04-30.4253637949\">\\n                        <img condition=\"hasPhotos\" src=\"https://www.wta.org/eye-white-on-blue.png\" />\\n                        See full trip report\\n                    </a>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n                \\n              \\n                \\n                  <div class=\"item\">\\n    <div class=\"item-row\">\\n        <div class=\"item-header\">\\n          <a class=\"listitem-title\" href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-04-28.3005546176\">\\n            Mount Ellinor\\n          </a>\\n          <h3 class=\"region\"><span class=\"region\">Olympic Peninsula -- Hood Canal</span></h3>\\n        </div>\\n\\n        <div class=\"col three\">\\n          <div class=\"listing-image\">\\n              <div class=\"thumb-background\">\\n                <a rel=\"lightbox\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-04-28.3005546176\">\\n                  <img src=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-04-28.3005546176/photo1_grid-thumb\" />\\n                </a>\\n              </div>\\n\\n              \\n          </div>\\n          <div class=\"media-indicator\">\\n              4 photos\\n              \\n          </div>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"col nine\">\\n            \\n              <div class=\"CreatorInfo\">\\n                  <span>\\n                      <a href=\"https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-GKeeffe\">\\n                          <div class=\"avatar\" style=\"width: 30px; background-image: url(\\'https://www.wta.org/defaultUser.png\\');\"></div>GKeeffe</a>\\n                  </span>\\n                  <div class=\"Badges\">\\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                  </div>\\n              </div>\\n            \\n            <p class=\"hike-date\">\\n              Hiked: <span class=\"elapsed-time\" title=\"Apr 27, 2018\">10 days ago</span>\\n            </p>\\n            <div class=\"trail-issues\">\\n              <strong>Beware of:</strong>\\n              snow, trail conditions\\n            </div>\\n\\n            <div class=\"trip-report-stats\">\\n              <div class=\"trip-features\">\\n                \\n                \\xa0\\n              </div>\\n              \\n                <div class=\"upvote\">\\n                    \\xa0\\n                    <p><img src=\"https://www.wta.org/++theme++plonetheme.wta/images/svg/trail-icons/thumbs-up.svg\" /> <span class=\"UpvoteCount\">28</span> people found this report helpful</p>\\n                </div>\\n              \\n            </div>\\n\\n            <div class=\"clear\">\\xa0</div>\\n\\n            <div class=\"report-text show-excerpt\">\\n                <div>\\n                    <a href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-04-28.3005546176/@@tr_listitem?show_full=c80ef7c284e5452aa9be26fb9995d9bf\" class=\"toggler\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n                       <span class=\"show-with-excerpt\">View report text</span>\\n                       <span class=\"show-with-full\">Hide report text</span>\\n                    </a>\\n                    <div class=\"show-with-full\"><p>Road to lower trail now completely snow free.
